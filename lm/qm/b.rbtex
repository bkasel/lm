\noindent Radioactivity is random, but do the laws of physics exhibit
randomness in other contexts besides radioactivity? Yes.
Radioactive decay was just a good playpen to get us started
with concepts of randomness, because all atoms of a given
isotope are identical. By stocking the playpen with an
unlimited supply of identical atom-toys, nature helped us to
realize that their future behavior could be different
regardless of their original identicality. We are now ready
to leave the playpen, and see how randomness fits into the
structure of physics at the most fundamental level.

The laws of physics describe light and matter, and the
quantum revolution rewrote both descriptions. Radioactivity
was a good example of matter's behaving in a way that was
inconsistent with classical physics, but if we want to get
under the hood and understand how nonclassical things
happen, it will be easier to focus on light rather than
matter. A radioactive atom such as uranium-235 is after all
an extremely complex system, consisting of 92 protons, 143
neutrons, and 92 electrons. Light, however, can be a simple sine wave.

However successful the classical wave theory of light had
been --- allowing the creation of \index{radio}radio and
\index{radar}radar, for example --- it still failed to
describe many important phenomena. An example that is
currently of great interest is the way the \index{ozone
layer}ozone layer protects us from the dangerous short-wavelength
\index{ultraviolet light}ultraviolet part of the sun's
spectrum. In the classical description, light is a wave.
When a wave passes into and back out of a medium, its
frequency is unchanged, and although its wavelength is
altered while it is in the medium, it returns to its
original value when the wave reemerges. Luckily for us, this
is not at all what ultraviolet light does when it passes
through the ozone layer, or the layer would offer no protection at all!

For a long time, physicists tried to explain away the
problems with the classical theory of light as arising from
an imperfect understanding of atoms and the interaction of
light with individual atoms and molecules. The ozone
paradox, for example, could have been attributed to the
incorrect assumption that  the ozone layer
was a smooth, continuous substance, when in reality it was
made of individual ozone molecules. It wasn't until 1905
that Albert Einstein threw down the gauntlet, proposing that
the problem had nothing to do with the details of light's
interaction with atoms and everything to do with the
fundamental nature of light itself.


In those days the data were sketchy, the ideas vague, and
the experiments difficult to interpret; it took a genius
like Einstein to cut through the thicket of confusion and
find a simple solution. Today, however, we can get right to
the heart of the matter with a piece of ordinary consumer
electronics, the \index{digital camera}digital camera.
Instead of film, a digital camera has a computer chip with
its surface divided up into a grid of light-sensitive
squares, called ``pixels.'' Compared to a grain of the
silver compound used to make regular photographic film, a
digital camera pixel is activated by an amount of light
energy orders of magnitude smaller. We can learn something
new about light by using a digital camera to detect smaller
and smaller amounts of light, as shown in figures \subfigref{ccd-spot}{1}
through \subfigref{ccd-spot}{3}. Figure 1 is fake, but 2 and 3 are
real digital-camera images made by Prof. Lyman Page of
Princeton University as a classroom demonstration.\label{lymanpage} Figure
1 is what we would see if we used the digital camera to
take a picture of a fairly dim source of light. In figures
2 and 3, the intensity of the light was  drastically
reduced by inserting semitransparent absorbers like the
tinted plastic used in sunglasses. Going from 1 to 2 to
3, more and more light energy is being thrown away by the absorbers.

  )
%>

<% end_marg %>
The results are dramatically different from what we would
expect based on the wave theory of light. If light was a
wave and nothing but a wave, \figref{attenuation-wave}, then the absorbers would
simply cut down the wave's amplitude across the whole
wavefront. The digital camera's entire chip would be
illuminated uniformly, and weakening the wave with an
absorber would just mean that every pixel would take a long
time to soak up enough energy to register a signal.

But figures \subfigref{ccd-spot}{2} and \subfigref{ccd-spot}{3} show that some pixels take strong
hits while others pick up no energy at all. Instead of the
wave picture, the image that is naturally evoked by the data
is something more like a hail of bullets from a machine gun,
\figref{attenuation-bullets}. Each ``bullet'' of light apparently carries only a tiny
amount of energy, which is why detecting them individually
requires a sensitive digital camera rather than an
eye or a piece of film.

Although Einstein was interpreting different observations,
this is the conclusion he reached in his 1905 paper: that
the pure wave theory of light is an oversimplification, and
that the energy of a beam of light comes in finite chunks
rather than being spread smoothly throughout a region of space.

We now think of these chunks as particles of light, and call
them ``\index{photon!Einstein's early theory}photons,''
although Einstein avoided the word ``particle,'' and the
word ``photon'' was invented later. Regardless of words, the
trouble was that waves and particles seemed like inconsistent
categories. The reaction to Einstein's paper could be kindly
described as vigorously skeptical. Even twenty years later,
Einstein wrote, ``There are therefore now two theories of
light, both indispensable, and --- as one must admit today
despite twenty years of tremendous effort on the part of
theoretical physicists --- without any logical connection.''
In the remainder of this chapter we will learn how the
seeming paradox was eventually resolved.

We have seen evidence that light energy comes in little
chunks, so the next question to be asked is naturally how
much energy is in one chunk. The most straightforward
experimental avenue for addressing this question is a
phenomenon known as the photoelectric effect. The photoelectric
effect occurs when a photon strikes the surface of a solid
object and knocks out an electron. It occurs continually all
around you. It is happening right now at the surface of your
skin and on the paper or computer screen from which you are
reading these words. It does not ordinarily lead to any
observable electrical effect, however, because on the
average, free electrons are wandering back in just as
frequently as they are being ejected. (If an object did
somehow lose a significant number of electrons, its growing
net positive charge would begin attracting the electrons
back more and more strongly.)

    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>
Figure \figref{photoelectric-apparatus-a} shows a practical method for detecting the
photoelectric effect. Two very clean parallel metal plates
(the electrodes of a capacitor) are sealed inside a vacuum
tube, and only one plate is exposed to light. Because there
is a good vacuum between the plates, any ejected electron
that happens to be headed in the right direction will almost
certainly reach the other capacitor plate without colliding
with any air molecules.

The illuminated (bottom) plate is left with a net positive
charge, and the unilluminated (top) plate acquires a
negative charge from the electrons deposited on it. There is
thus an electric field between the plates, and it is because
of this field that the electrons' paths are curved, as shown
in the diagram. However, since vacuum is a good insulator,
any electrons that reach the top plate are prevented from
responding to the electrical attraction by jumping back
across the gap. Instead they are forced to make their way
around the circuit, passing through an ammeter. The ammeter
measures the strength of the photoelectric effect.

<% end_sec() %>
<% begin_sec("An unexpected dependence on frequency") %>

The photoelectric effect was discovered serendipitously by
Heinrich \index{Hertz, Heinrich}Hertz in 1887, as he was
experimenting with radio waves. He was not particularly
interested in the phenomenon, but he did notice that the
effect was produced strongly by ultraviolet light and more
weakly by lower frequencies. Light whose frequency was lower
than a certain critical value did not eject any electrons at
all.\footnote{In fact this was all prior to Thomson's discovery of
the electron, so Hertz would not have described the effect
in terms of electrons --- we are discussing everything with
the benefit of hindsight.} This dependence on frequency
didn't make any sense in terms of the classical wave theory
of light. A light wave consists of electric and magnetic
fields. The stronger the fields, i.e., the greater the wave's
amplitude, the greater the forces that would be exerted on
electrons that found themselves bathed in the light. It
should have been amplitude (brightness) that was relevant,
not frequency. The dependence on frequency not only proves
that the wave model of light needs modifying, but with the
proper interpretation it allows us to determine how much
energy is in one photon, and it also leads to a connection
between the wave and particle models that we need in
order to reconcile them.

      than the tiled floor, so as she rolls up the step, the hamster will
      lose a certain amount of kinetic energy, analogous to $E_s$. If her
      kinetic energy is too small, she won't even make it up the step.
    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>
 %
To make any progress, we need to consider the physical
process by which a photon would eject an electron from the
metal electrode. A metal contains electrons that are free to
move around. Ordinarily, in the interior of the metal, such
an electron feels attractive forces from atoms in every
direction around it. The forces cancel out. But if the
electron happens to find itself at the surface of the metal,
the attraction from the interior side is not balanced out by
any attraction from outside.
In popping out through the surface the electron therefore loses
some amount of energy $E_s$, which depends on the type of metal used.

Suppose a photon strikes an electron, annihilating itself
and giving up all its energy to the electron.\footnote{We now know
that this is what always happens in the photoelectric
effect, although it had not yet been established in 1905
whether or not the photon was completely annihilated.} The
electron will (1) lose kinetic energy through collisions
with other electrons as it plows through the metal on its
way to the surface; (2) lose an amount of kinetic energy
equal to $E_s$ as it emerges through the surface; and (3) lose
more energy on its way across the gap between the plates,
due to the electric field between the plates. Even if the
electron happens to be right at the surface of the metal
when it absorbs the photon, and even if the electric field
between the plates has not yet built up very much, $E_s$ is
the bare minimum amount of energy that the electron must receive from
the photon if it is to contribute to a measurable current.
The reason for using very clean electrodes is to minimize
$E_s$ and make it have a definite value characteristic of the
metal surface, not a mixture of values due to the various
types of dirt and crud that are present in tiny amounts on
all surfaces in everyday life.

We can now interpret the frequency dependence of the
photoelectric effect in a simple way: apparently the amount
of energy possessed by a photon is related to its frequency.
A low-frequency red or infrared photon has an energy less
than $E_s$, so a beam of them will not produce any current.  A
high-frequency blue or violet photon, on the other hand,
packs enough of a punch to allow an electron to get out of the electrode.
At frequencies higher than the minimum, the
photoelectric current continues to increase with the
frequency of the light because of effects (1) and (3).

<% end_sec() %>
<% begin_sec("Numerical relationship between energy and frequency") %>
Figure \figref{photoelectric-apparatus-b} shows an experiment that is used sometimes in
college laboratory courses to probe the relationship between the energy and frequency
of a photon. The idea is simply to illuminate
one plate of the vacuum tube with light of a single
wavelength and monitor the voltage difference between the
two plates as they charge up. Since the resistance of a
voltmeter is very high (much higher than the resistance of
an ammeter), we can assume to a good approximation that
electrons reaching the top plate are stuck there permanently,
so the voltage will keep on increasing for as long as
electrons are making it across the vacuum tube.

    }

%>

<% end_marg %>
At a moment when the voltage difference has a reached a
value $\Delta $V, the minimum energy required by an electron
to make it out of the bottom plate and across the gap to the
other plate is $E_s+e\Delta $V. As $\Delta V$ increases, we
eventually reach a point at which $E_s+e\Delta V$ equals the
energy of one photon. No more electrons can cross the gap,
and the reading on the voltmeter stops rising. The quantity
$E_s+e\Delta V$ now tells us the energy of one photon. If we
determine this energy for a variety of frequencies, \figref{photoelectric-graph}, we
find the following simple relationship between the energy of
a \index{photon!energy of}photon and the frequency of the light:
\begin{equation*}
        E  =  hf\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $h$ is a constant with a numerical value of
$6.63\times10^{-34}\ \junit\unitdot\sunit$.\linebreak[4]
Note how the equation brings the
wave and particle models of light under the same roof: the
left side is the energy of one \emph{particle} of light,
while the right side is the frequency of the same light,
interpreted as a \emph{wave}. The constant $h$ is known as
\index{Planck, Max}\index{Planck's constant}Planck's constant,\label{planck-constant}
after theorist Max Planck.

Since the energy of a photon is $hf$, a beam of light
can only have energies of $hf$, $2hf$, $3hf$,
etc. Its energy is quantized --- there is no such thing as a
fraction of a photon. Quantum physics gets its name from the
fact that it quantizes things like energy, momentum, and
angular momentum that had previously been thought to be
smooth, continuous and infinitely divisible.

\begin{eg}{Number of photons emitted by a lightbulb per second}\label{eg:photons-from-lightbulb}
\egquestion Roughly how many photons are emitted by a 100-W
lightbulb in 1 second?

\eganswer People tend to remember wavelengths rather than
frequencies for visible light. The bulb emits photons with a
range of frequencies and wavelengths, but let's take 600 nm
as a typical wavelength for purposes of estimation. The
energy of a single photon is
\begin{align*}
        E_{photon}     &=  hf\\
             &=    \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\end{align*}
A power of 100 W means 100 joules per second, so the
number of photons is
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{100\ \junit}{E_{photon}}
             =    \frac{100\ \junit}{hc/\lambda}
        \approx 3\times10^{20}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
This hugeness of this number is consistent with the correspondence principle.
The experiments that established the classical theory of optics
weren't wrong. They were right, within their domain of applicability, in which
the number of photons was so large as to be indistinguishable from a continuous beam.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Measuring the wave}\label{eg:am-radio-photon-density}
When surfers are out on the water waiting for their chance to catch a wave, they're interested
in both the height of the waves and when the waves are going to arrive. In other words, they
observe both the amplitude and phase of the waves, and it doesn't matter to them that
the water is granular at the molecular level. The correspondence principle requires that we
be able to do the same thing for electromagnetic waves, since the classical theory of electricity
and magnetism was all stated and verified experimentally in terms of the fields $\vc{E}$ and $\vc{B}$,
which are the amplitude of an electromagnetic wave. The phase is also necessary, since the laws of
induction predict different results depending on whether an oscillating field is on its way up or
on its way back down.

This is a more demanding application of the correspondence principle than the one in 
example \ref{eg:photons-from-lightbulb}, since amplitudes and phases constitute more detailed
information than the over-all intensity of a beam of light. Eyeball measurements can't detect
this type of information, since the eye is much bigger than a wavelength,
but for example an AM radio receiver can do it with radio waves, since
the wavelength for a station at 1000 kHz is about 300 meters, which is much larger than the antenna.
The correspondence principle demands that we be able to explain this in terms of the photon
theory, and this requires not just that we have a large number of photons emitted by the transmitter
per second, as in example \ref{eg:photons-from-lightbulb}, but that even by the time they spread out
and reach the receiving antenna, there should be many photons overlapping each other within a space
of one cubic wavelength. Problem \ref{hw:am-radio-photon-density} on p.~\pageref{hw:am-radio-photon-density}
verifies that the number is in fact extremely large.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Momentum of a photon}\label{eg:photon-momentum}
\egquestion According to the theory of relativity, the
momentum of a beam of light is given by $p=E/c$ (see homework problem \ref{hw:ultrarelativistic}
on page \pageref{hw:ultrarelativistic}). Apply this to find the momentum of a
single photon in terms of its frequency, and in terms of its wavelength.

\eganswer Combining the equations $p=E/c$ and $E=hf$, we find
\begin{align*}
        p     &=    \frac{E}{c}  \\
             &=   \frac{hf}{c}\eqquad.
\end{align*}
To reexpress this in terms of wavelength, we use $c=f\lambda $:
\begin{align*}
        p     &=  \frac{hf}{f\lambda}   \\
             &=\frac{h}{\lambda}
\end{align*}
The second form turns out to be simpler.

Up until now I've been sneaky and avoided a full discussion
of the three-dimensional aspects of the probability
interpretation. The example of the carrot in the microwave
oven, for example, reduced to a one-dimensional situation
because we were considering three points along the same line
and because we were only comparing ratios of probabilities.

A typical example of a probability distribution in section \ref{sec:prob-dist}
was the distribution of heights of human beings. The thing
that varied randomly, height, $h$, had units of meters, and
the probability distribution was a graph of a function
$D(h)$. The units of the probability distribution had to be
$\zu{m}^{-1}$ (inverse meters) so that areas under the curve,
interpreted as probabilities, would be unitless:
$(\text{area})=(\text{height})(\text{width})=\zu{m}^{-1}\cdot\zu{m}$.

<% marg(0) %>

Now suppose we have a two-dimensional problem, e.g., the
probability distribution for the place on the surface of a
digital camera chip where a photon will be detected. The
point where it is detected would be described with two
variables, $x$ and $y$, each having units of meters. The
probability distribution will be a function of both
variables, $D(x,y)$. A probability is now visualized as the
volume under the surface described by the function $D(x,y)$,
as shown in figure \figref{volume-under-surface}. The units of $D$ must be $\munit^{-2}$ so
that probabilities will be unitless:
$(\text{probability})=(\text{depth})(\text{length})(\text{width})
=\zu{m}^{-2}\cdot\zu{m}\cdot\zu{m}$.

Generalizing finally to three dimensions, we find by analogy
that the probability distribution will be a function of all
three coordinates, $D(x,y,z)$, and will have units of $\munit^{-3}$.
It is, unfortunately, impossible to visualize the graph
unless you are a mutant with a natural feel for life in four
dimensions. If the probability distribution is nearly
constant within a certain volume of space $v$, the
probability that the photon is in that volume is simply
$vD$. If you know enough calculus, it should be clear
that this can be generalized to $P=\int D \der x \der y \der z$ if $D$ is not constant.

\begin{summarytext}

Around the turn of the twentieth century, experiments began
to show problems with the classical wave theory of light. In
any experiment sensitive enough to detect very small amounts
of light energy, it becomes clear that light energy cannot
be divided into chunks smaller than a certain amount.
Measurements involving the photoelectric effect demonstrate
that this smallest unit of light energy equals $hf$,
where $f$ is the frequency of the light and $h$ is a number
known as Planck's constant. We say that light energy is
quantized in units of $hf$, and we interpret this
quantization as evidence that light has particle properties
as well as wave properties. Particles of light are called photons.

The only method of reconciling the wave and particle natures
of light that has stood the test of experiment is the
probability interpretation: the probability
that the particle is at a given location is proportional to
the square of the amplitude of the wave at that location.

One important consequence of wave-particle duality is that
we must abandon the concept of the path the particle takes
through space. To hold on to this concept, we would have to
contradict the well established wave nature of light, since
a wave can spread out in every direction simultaneously.

produce a small number of ejected electrons.) The purpose of
this problem is to show that the lack of a significant time
delay contradicted the classical wave theory of light, so
throughout this problem you should put yourself in the shoes
of a classical physicist and pretend you don't know about
photons at all. At that time, it was thought that the
electron might have a radius on the order of $10^{-15}$ m.
(Recent experiments have shown that if the electron has any
finite size at all, it is far smaller.)\hwendpart
(a) Estimate the power that would be soaked up by a single
electron in a beam of light with an intensity of $1\ \zu{mW}/\munit^2$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) The energy, $E_s$, required for the electron to escape
through the surface of the cathode is on the order of
$10^{-19}\ \junit$. Find how long it would take the electron to
absorb this amount of energy, and explain why your result
constitutes strong evidence that there is something wrong
with the classical theory.\answercheck\hwendpart

Many radio antennas are designed so that they preferentially emit or receive
electromagnetic waves in a certain direction. However, no antenna is perfectly
directional.
The wave shown in the figure represents a single photon being emitted by
an antenna at the center. The antenna is directional, so there is a stronger
wave on
the right than on the left. What is the probability that the photon will be
observed on the right?
