In example \ref{eg:cern-muons} on page \pageref{eg:cern-muons}, I remarked that accelerating a macroscopic
(i.e., not microscopic) object to close to the speed of light would require an unreasonable amount of energy.
Suppose that the starship Enterprise from Star Trek has a mass of $8.0\times10^7$ kg, about the same as the Queen Elizabeth 2.
Compute the kinetic energy it would have to have if it was moving at half the speed of light. Compare with the total
energy content of the world's nuclear arsenals, which is about $10^{21}$ J.\answercheck

<% begin_hw('freeneutron') %>

(a) A free neutron (as opposed to a neutron bound into
an atomic nucleus) is unstable, and undergoes beta decay (which you
may want to review).
The masses of the particles involved are as follows:

\qquad\begin{tabular}{ll}
        neutron                & $1.67495\times10^{-27}$  kg\\
        proton                & $1.67265\times10^{-27}$  kg\\
        electron        & $0.00091\times10^{-27}$  kg\\
        antineutrino        & $<10^{-35}$ kg\\
\end{tabular}

\noindent Find the energy released in the decay of a free neutron. \answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Neutrons and protons make up essentially all of the mass of the ordinary
matter around us. We observe that the universe around us has no free neutrons, but
lots of free protons
(the nuclei of hydrogen, which is the element that 90\% of the universe
is made of). We find neutrons only inside nuclei along with other neutrons and
protons, not on their own.

If there are processes that can convert neutrons into protons, we might imagine
that there could also be proton-to-neutron conversions, and indeed such a process
does occur sometimes in nuclei that contain both neutrons and protons:
a proton can decay into a
neutron, a positron, and a neutrino. A positron is a particle with the same
properties as an electron, except that its electrical charge is positive
(see chapter 7). A neutrino, like an antineutrino, has negligible mass.

Although such a process
can occur within a nucleus, explain why it cannot happen to
a free proton. (If it could, hydrogen would be radioactive, and you
wouldn't exist!)

\index{momentum!of light}\index{light!momentum of}
An object moving at a speed very close to the speed of light is referred to as
ultrarelativistic. Ordinarily (luckily) the only ultrarelativistic objects
in our universe are subatomic particles, such as cosmic rays or particles
that have been accelerated in a particle accelerator.\hwendpart
(a) What kind of number is $\gamma$ for an ultrarelativistic particle?\hwendpart
(b) Repeat example \ref{eg:massenergy-low-speed} on page \pageref{eg:massenergy-low-speed},
but instead of very low, nonrelativistic speeds, consider ultrarelativistic speeds.\hwendpart
(c) Find an equation for the ratio $\massenergy/p$. The speed may be relativistic, but don't
assume that it's ultrarelativistic.\answercheck\hwendpart
(d) Simplify your answer to part c for the case where the speed is ultrarelativistic.\answercheck\hwendpart
(e) We can think of a beam of light as an ultrarelativistic object --- it certainly moves at a speed
that's sufficiently close to the speed of light! Suppose you turn on a one-watt flashlight, leave it
on for one second, and then turn it off. Compute the momentum of the recoiling flashlight, in units
of $\kgunit\unitdot\munit/\sunit$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(f) Discuss how part e relates to the correspondence principle.

   In this exercise you will analyze the Michelson-Morley
experiment, and find what the results should have been
according to Galilean relativity and Einstein's theory of
relativity. A beam of light coming from the west (not shown)
comes to the half-silvered mirror A. Half the light goes
through to the east, is reflected by mirror C, and comes
back to A. The other half is reflected north by A, is
reflected by B, and also comes back to A. When the beams
reunite at A, part of each ends up going south, and these
parts interfere with one another. If the time taken for a
round trip differs by, for example, half the period of the
wave, there will be destructive interference.

   The point of the experiment was to search for a
difference in the experimental results between the daytime,
when the laboratory was moving west relative to the sun, and
the nighttime, when the laboratory was moving east relative
to the sun. Galilean relativity and Einstein's theory of
relativity make different predictions about the results.
According to Galilean relativity, the speed of light cannot
be the same in all reference frames, so it is assumed that
there is one special reference frame, perhaps the sun's, in
which light travels at the same speed in all directions; in
other frames, Galilean relativity predicts that the speed of
light will be different in different directions, e.g., slower
if the observer is chasing a beam of light. There are four
different ways to analyze the experiment:

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Laboratory's frame of reference, Galilean
relativity}. This is not a useful way to analyze the
experiment, since one does not know how fast light will
travel in various directions.

\item \emph{Sun's frame of reference, Galilean relativity}. We
assume that in this special frame of reference, the speed of
light is the same in all directions: we call this speed $c$.
In this frame, the laboratory moves with velocity $v$, and
mirrors A, B, and C move while the light beam is in flight.

\item \emph{Laboratory's frame of reference, Einstein's theory
of relativity}. The analysis is extremely simple. Let the
length of each arm be $L$. Then the time required to get
from A to either mirror is $L/c$, so each beam's round-trip time is $2L/c$.

\item \emph{Sun's frame of reference, Einstein's theory of
relativity}. We analyze this case by starting with the
laboratory's frame of reference and then transforming to the sun's frame.
\end{itemize}

Groups 1-4 work in the sun's frame of reference according to
Galilean relativity.

Group 1 finds time AC. Group 2 finds time CA. Group 3 finds
time AB. Group 4 finds time BA.  

Groups 5 and 6 transform the lab-frame results into the
sun's frame according to Einstein's theory.

Group 5 transforms the $x$ and $t$ when ray ACA gets back to
A into the sun's frame of reference, and group 6 does
the same for ray ABA.

Discussion:

Michelson and Morley found no change in the interference of
the waves between day and night. Which version of relativity
is consistent with their results?

What does each theory predict if $v$ approaches $c$?

What if the arms are not exactly equal in length?

Does it matter if the ``special'' frame is some frame
other than the sun's?

\extitle{B}{Sports in Slowlightland}

In Slowlightland, the speed of light is 20 mi/hr  $\approx$ 32 km/hr $\approx$ 
9 m/s. Think of an example of how relativistic effects would
work in sports. Things can get very complex very quickly, so
try to think of a simple example that focuses on just one of
the following effects:

- relativistic momentum

- relativistic kinetic energy

- relativistic addition of velocities

- time dilation and length contraction

- Doppler shifts of light

- equivalence of mass and energy

- time it takes for light to get to an athlete's eye

- deflection of light rays by gravity
