        \epigraph{Where the telescope ends, the microscope begins. Which of
        the two has the grander view?}{Victor Hugo}\index{Hugo, Victor}

        His father died during his mother's pregnancy. Rejected by
        her as a boy, he was packed off to boarding school when she
        remarried. He himself never married, but in middle age he
        formed an intense relationship with a much younger man, a
        relationship that he terminated when he underwent a
        psychotic break. Following his early scientific successes,
        he spent the rest of his professional life mostly in
        frustration over his inability to unlock the secrets of alchemy.

        The man being described is Isaac Newton, but not the
        triumphant \index{Newton, Isaac!alchemy}Newton of the standard
        textbook hagiography. Why dwell on the sad side of his life?
        To the modern science educator, Newton's lifelong obsession
        with alchemy may seem an embarrassment, a distraction from
        his main achievement, the creation the modern science of
        mechanics. To Newton, however, his alchemical researches
        were naturally related to his investigations of force and
        motion. What was radical about Newton's analysis of motion
        was its universality: it succeeded in describing both the
        heavens and the earth with the same equations, whereas
        previously it had been assumed that the sun, moon, stars,
        and planets were fundamentally different from earthly
        objects. But Newton realized that if science was to describe
        all of nature in a unified way, it was not enough to unite
        the human scale with the scale of the universe: he would not
        be satisfied until he fit the microscopic universe into
        the picture as well.

        It should not surprise us that Newton failed. Although he
        was a firm believer in the existence of atoms, there was no
        more experimental evidence for their existence than there
        had been when the ancient Greeks first posited them on
        purely philosophical grounds. \index{alchemy}Alchemy labored
        under a tradition of secrecy and mysticism. Newton had
        already almost single-handedly transformed the fuzzyheaded
        field of ``natural philosophy'' into something we would
        recognize as the modern science of physics, and it would be
        unjust to criticize him for failing to change alchemy into
        modern chemistry as well. The time was not ripe. The
        microscope was a new invention, and it was cutting-edge
        science when Newton's contemporary \index{Hooke}Hooke
        discovered that living things were made out of cells.

        Nevertheless it will be instructive to pick up Newton's
        train of thought and see where it leads us with the benefit
        of modern hindsight. In uniting the human and cosmic scales
        of existence, he had reimagined both as stages on which the
        actors were objects (trees and houses, planets and stars)
        that interacted through attractions and repulsions. He was
        already convinced that the objects inhabiting the microworld
        were atoms, so it remained only to determine what kinds of
        forces they exerted on each other.

        His next insight was no less brilliant for his inability to
        bring it to fruition. He realized that the many human-scale
        forces --- friction, sticky forces, the normal forces that
        keep objects from occupying the same space, and so on ---
        must all simply be expressions of a more fundamental force
        acting between atoms. Tape sticks to paper because the atoms
        in the tape attract the atoms in the paper. My house doesn't
        fall to the center of the earth because its atoms repel the
        atoms of the dirt under it.

        Here he got stuck. It was tempting to think that the atomic
        force was a form of gravity, which he knew to be universal,
        fundamental, and mathematically simple. Gravity, however, is
        always attractive, so how could he use it to explain the
        existence of both attractive and repulsive atomic forces?
        The gravitational force between objects of ordinary size is
        also extremely small, which is why we never notice cars and
        houses attracting us gravitationally. It would be hard to
        understand how gravity could be responsible for anything as
        vigorous as the beating of a heart or the explosion of
        gunpowder. Newton went on to write a million words of
        alchemical notes filled with speculation about some other
        force, perhaps a ``divine force'' or ``vegetative force''
        that would for example be carried by the sperm to the egg.

<% end_marg %>
        Luckily, we now know enough to investigate a different
        suspect as a candidate for the atomic force: electricity.
        \index{electric forces}Electric forces are often observed
        between objects that have been prepared by rubbing (or other
        surface interactions), for instance when clothes rub against
        each other in the dryer. A useful example is shown in figure
        \figref{twotapes}/1: stick two pieces of tape on a tabletop, and then put
        two more pieces on top of them. Lift each pair from the
        table, and then separate them. The two top pieces will then
        repel each other, \figref{twotapes}/2, as will the two bottom pieces. A
        bottom piece will attract a top piece, however, \figref{twotapes}/3.
        Electrical forces like these are similar in certain ways to
        gravity, the other force that we already know to be fundamental:

        \begin{itemize}
        \item Electrical forces are \emph{universal}. Although some
        substances, such as fur, rubber, and plastic, respond more
        strongly to electrical preparation than others, all matter
        participates in electrical forces to some degree. There is
        no such thing as a ``nonelectric'' substance. Matter is both
        inherently gravitational and inherently electrical.

        \item Experiments show that the electrical force, like the
        gravitational force, is an \emph{inverse square} force. That
        is, the electrical force between two spheres is proportional
        to $1/r^2$, where $r$ is the center-to-center distance between them.
        \end{itemize}

        Furthermore, electrical forces make more sense than gravity
        as candidates for the fundamental force between atoms,
        because we have observed that they can be either attractive or repulsive.

        ``\index{charge}Charge'' is the technical term used to
        indicate that an object has been prepared so as to
        participate in electrical forces. This is to be distinguished
        from the common usage, in which the term is used indiscriminately
        for anything electrical. For example, although we speak
        colloquially of ``charging'' a battery, you may easily
        verify that a battery has no charge in the technical sense,
        e.g., it does not exert any electrical force on a piece of
        tape that has been prepared as described in the previous section.

<% end_sec() %>
<% begin_sec("Two types of charge") %>

        We can easily collect reams of data on electrical forces
        between different substances that have been charged in
        different ways. We find for example that cat fur prepared by
        rubbing against rabbit fur will attract glass that has been
        rubbed on silk. How can we make any sense of all this
        information? A vast simplification is achieved by noting
        that there are really only two types of charge. Suppose we
        pick cat fur rubbed on rabbit fur as a representative of
        type A, and glass rubbed on silk for type B. We will now
        find that there is no ``type C.'' Any object electrified by
        any method is either A-like, attracting things A attracts
        and repelling those it repels, or B-like, displaying the
        same attractions and repulsions as B. The two types, A and
        B, always display opposite interactions. If A displays an
        attraction with some charged object, then B is guaranteed
        to undergo repulsion with it, and vice-versa.

<% end_sec() %>
<% begin_sec("The coulomb") %>\index{coulomb (unit)}

        Although there are only two types of charge, each type can
        come in different amounts. The metric unit of charge is the
        coulomb (rhymes with ``drool on''), defined as follows:

        \begin{lessimportant}
        One Coulomb (C) is the amount of charge such that
        a force of $9.0\times10^9$ N occurs between two pointlike
        objects with charges of 1 C separated by a distance of 1 m.
        \end{lessimportant}

        The notation for an amount of charge is $q$. The numerical
        factor in the definition is historical in origin, and is not
        worth memorizing. The definition is stated for pointlike,
        i.e., very small, objects, because otherwise different parts
        of them would be at different distances from each other.

<% end_sec() %>
<% begin_sec("A model of two types of charged particles") %>

        Experiments show that all the methods of rubbing or
        otherwise charging objects involve two objects, and both of
        them end up getting charged. If one object acquires a
        certain amount of one type of charge, then the other ends up
        with an equal amount of the other type. Various interpretations
        of this are possible, but the simplest is that the basic
        building blocks of matter come in two flavors, one with each
        type of charge. Rubbing objects together results in the
        transfer of some of these particles from one object to the
        other. In this model, an object that has not been electrically
        prepared may actually possesses a great deal of \emph{both}
        types of charge, but the amounts are equal and they are
        distributed in the same way throughout it. Since type A
        repels anything that type B attracts, and vice versa, the
        object will make a total force of zero on any other object.
        The rest of this chapter fleshes out this model and
        discusses how these mysterious particles can be understood
        as being internal parts of atoms.

<% end_sec() %>
<% begin_sec("Use of positive and negative signs for charge") %>

        Because the two types of charge tend to cancel out each
        other's forces, it makes sense to label them using positive
        and negative signs, and to discuss the \emph{total} charge
        of an object. It is entirely arbitrary which type of charge
        to call negative and which to call positive. Benjamin
        \index{Franklin, Benjamin!definition of signs of charge}Franklin
        decided to describe the one we've been calling ``A'' as
        negative, but it really doesn't matter as long as everyone
        is consistent with everyone else. An object with a total
        charge of zero (equal amounts of both types) is referred to
        as electrically $\index{neutral (electrically)}neutral$.

        \index{Coulomb's law}
        A large body of experimental observations can be summarized as follows:  

        \begin{important}
        Coulomb's law: The magnitude of the force acting between pointlike charged
        objects at a center-to-center distance $r$ is given by the equation
        \begin{equation*}
                        |\vc{F}|        =    k\frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}\eqquad,  
        \end{equation*}
        where the constant $k$ equals $9.0\times10^9\ \zu{N}\unitdot\zu{m}^2/\zu{C}^2$.
        The force is attractive if the charges are of different
        signs, and repulsive if they have the same sign.
        \end{important}

        Clever modern techniques have allowed the $1/r^2$ form of
        Coulomb's law to be tested to incredible accuracy, showing
        that the exponent is in the range from 1.9999999999999998
        to 2.0000000000000002.

        Note that Coulomb's law is closely analogous to Newton's law
        of gravity, where the magnitude of the force is $Gm_1m_2/r^2$, except
        that there is only one type of mass, not two, and gravitational
        forces are never repulsive. Because of this close analogy
        between the two types of forces, we can recycle a great deal
        of our knowledge of gravitational forces. For instance,
        there is an electrical equivalent of the shell theorem: the
        electrical forces exerted externally by a uniformly charged
        spherical shell are the same as if all the charge was
        concentrated at its center, and the forces exerted
        internally are zero.

<% end_sec() %>
<% begin_sec("Conservation of charge") %>\index{charge!conservation of}

        An even more fundamental reason for using positive and
        negative signs for electrical charge is that experiments
        show that charge is conserved according to this definition:
        in any closed system, the total amount of charge is a
        constant. This is why we observe that rubbing initially
        uncharged substances together always has the result that one
        gains a certain amount of one type of charge, while the
        other acquires an equal amount of the other type. Conservation
        of charge seems natural in our model in which matter is made
        of positive and negative particles. If the charge on each
        particle is a fixed property of that type of particle, and
        if the particles themselves can be neither created nor
        destroyed, then conservation of charge is inevitable.

        As shown in figure \figref{scrapsofpaper}, an electrically charged object can
        attract objects that are uncharged. How is this possible?
        The key is that even though each piece of paper has a total
        charge of zero, it has at least some charged particles in it
        that have some freedom to move. Suppose that the tape is
        positively charged, \figref{induction}. Mobile particles in the paper will
        respond to the tape's forces, causing one end of the paper to
        become negatively charged and the other to become positive.
        The attraction between the paper and the tape is now
        stronger than the repulsion, because the negatively charged
        end is closer to the tape.

        We have begun to encounter complex electrical behavior that
        we would never have realized was occurring just from the
        evidence of our eyes. Unlike the pulleys, blocks, and
        inclined planes of mechanics, the actors on the stage of
        electricity and magnetism are invisible phenomena alien to
        our everyday experience. For this reason, the flavor of the
        second half of your physics education is dramatically
        different, focusing much more on experiments and techniques.
        Even though you will never actually see charge moving
        through a wire, you can learn to use an ammeter to measure the flow.

        Students also tend to get the impression from their first
        semester of physics that it is a dead science. Not so! We
        are about to pick up the historical trail that leads
        directly to the cutting-edge physics research you read about
        in the newspaper. The atom-smashing experiments that began
        around 1900, which we will be studying in this chapter,
        were not that different from the ones of the year 2000 ---
        just smaller, simpler, and much cheaper.

<% begin_sec("Magnetic forces") %>

\enlargethispage{-\baselineskip}

        A detailed mathematical treatment of magnetism won't come
        until much later in this book, but we need to develop a few
        simple ideas about magnetism now because magnetic forces are
        used in the experiments and techniques we come to next.
        Everyday magnets come in two general types. Permanent
        magnets, such as the ones on your refrigerator, are made of
        iron or substances like steel that contain iron atoms.
        (Certain other substances also work, but iron is the
        cheapest and most common.) The other type of magnet, an
        example of which is the ones that make your stereo speakers
        vibrate, consist of coils of wire through which electric
        charge flows. Both types of magnets are able to attract iron
        that has not been magnetically prepared, for instance the
        door of the refrigerator.  

        A single insight makes these apparently complex phenomena
        much simpler to understand: magnetic forces are interactions
        between moving charges, occurring in addition to the
        electric forces. Suppose a permanent magnet is brought near
        a magnet of the coiled-wire type. The coiled wire has moving
        charges in it because we force charge to flow. The permanent
        magnet also has moving charges in it, but in this case the
        charges that naturally swirl around inside the iron. (What
        makes a magnetized piece of iron different from a block of
        wood is that the motion of the charge in the wood is random
        rather than organized.) The moving charges in the coiled-wire
        magnet exert a force on the moving charges in the permanent
        magnet, and vice-versa.

        The mathematics of magnetism is significantly more complex
        than the Coulomb force law for electricity, which is why we
        will wait until chapter \ref{ch:em} before delving deeply into it. Two
        simple facts will suffice for now:

        (1) If a charged particle is moving in a region of space
        near where other charged particles are also moving, their
        magnetic force on it is directly proportional to its velocity.

        (2) The magnetic force on a moving charged particle is
        always perpendicular to the direction the particle is moving.

        \begin{eg}{A magnetic compass}
                The Earth is molten inside, and like a pot of boiling water,
                it roils and churns. To make a drastic oversimplification,
                electric charge can get carried along with the churning
                motion, so the Earth contains moving charge. The needle of a
                magnetic compass is itself a small permanent magnet. The
                moving charge inside the earth interacts magnetically with
                the moving charge inside the compass needle, causing the
        compass needle to twist around and point north.
        \end{eg}

\begin{eg}{A television tube}
        A TV picture is painted by a stream of electrons coming from
        the back of the tube to the front. The beam scans across the
        whole surface of the tube like a reader scanning a page of a
        book. Magnetic forces are used to steer the beam. As the
        beam comes from the back of the tube to the front, up-down
        and left-right forces are needed for steering. But magnetic
        forces cannot be used to get the beam up to speed in the
        first place, since they can only push perpendicular to the
        electrons' direction of motion, not forward along it.

<% begin_sec("Atomism") %>\index{Atomism}

        The Greeks have been kicked around a lot in the last couple
        of millennia: dominated by the Romans, bullied during the
        crusades by warlords going to and from the Holy Land, and
        occupied by Turkey until recently. It's no wonder they
        prefer to remember their salad days, when their best
        thinkers came up with concepts like democracy and atoms.
        Greece is democratic again after a period of military
        dictatorship, and an \index{atom}atom is proudly pictured on
        one of their coins. That's why it hurts me to have to say
        that the ancient Greek hypothesis that matter is made of
        atoms was pure guesswork. There was no real experimental
        evidence for atoms, and the 18th-century revival of the atom
        concept by Dalton owed little to the Greeks other than the
        name, which means ``unsplittable.'' Subtracting even more
        cruelly from Greek glory, the name was shown to be
        inappropriate in 1897 when physicist J.J. Thomson proved
        experimentally that atoms had even smaller things inside
        them, which could be extracted. (Thomson called them
        ``electrons.'') The ``unsplittable'' was splittable after all.

        But that's getting ahead of our story. What happened to the
        atom concept in the intervening two thousand years? Educated
        people continued to discuss the idea, and those who were in
        favor of it could often use it to give plausible explanations
        for various facts and phenomena. One fact that was readily
        explained was conservation of mass. For example, if you mix
        1 kg of water with 1 kg of dirt, you get exactly 2 kg of
        mud, no more and no less. The same is true for the a variety
        of processes such as freezing of water, fermenting beer, or
        pulverizing sandstone. If you believed in atoms, \index{conservation
        of mass}conservation of \index{mass!conservation of}mass
        made perfect sense, because all these processes could be
        interpreted as mixing and rearranging atoms, without
        changing the total number of atoms. Still, this is nothing
        like a proof that atoms exist.

        If atoms did exist, what types of atoms were there, and what
        distinguished the different types from each other? Was it
        their sizes, their shapes, their weights, or some other
        quality? The chasm between the ancient and modern atomisms
        becomes evident when we consider the wild speculations that
        existed on these issues until the present century. The
        ancients decided that there were four types of atoms, earth,
        water, air and fire; the most popular view was that they
        were distinguished by their shapes. Water atoms were
        spherical, hence water's ability to flow smoothly. Fire
        atoms had sharp points, which was why fire hurt when it
        touched one's skin. (There was no concept of temperature
        until thousands of years later.) The drastically different
        modern understanding of the structure of atoms was achieved
        in the course of the revolutionary decade stretching 1895 to
        1905. The main purpose of this chapter is to describe
        those momentous experiments.

        Although I tend to ridicule ancient Greek philosophers like
        Aristotle, let's take a moment to praise him for something.
        If you read Aristotle's writings on physics (or just skim
        them, which is all I've done), the most striking thing is
        how careful he is about classifying phenomena and analyzing
        relationships among phenomena. The human brain seems to
        naturally make a distinction between two types of physical
        phenomena: objects and motion of objects. When a phenomenon
        occurs that does not immediately present itself as one of
        these, there is a strong tendency to conceptualize it as one
        or the other, or even to ignore its existence completely.
        For instance, physics teachers shudder at students'
        statements that ``the dynamite exploded, and force came out
        of it in all directions.'' In these examples, the nonmaterial
        concept of force is being mentally categorized as if it was
        a physical substance. The statement that ``winding the clock
        stores motion in the spring'' is a miscategorization of
        electrical energy as a form of motion. An example of ignoring
        the existence of a phenomenon altogether can be elicited by
        asking people why we need lamps. The typical response that
        ``the lamp illuminates the room so we can see things,''
        ignores the necessary role of light coming into our eyes
        from the things being illuminated.

        If you ask someone to tell you briefly about atoms, the
        likely response is that ``everything is made of atoms,'' but
        we've now seen that it's far from obvious which ``everything''
        this statement would properly refer to. For the scientists
        of the early 1900s who were trying to investigate atoms,
        this was not a trivial issue of definitions. There was a new
        gizmo called the vacuum tube, of which the only familiar
        example today is the picture tube of a TV. In short order,
        electrical tinkerers had discovered a whole flock of new
        phenomena that occurred in and around vacuum tubes, and
        given them picturesque names like ``x-rays,'' ``cathode
        rays,'' ``Hertzian waves,'' and ``N-rays.'' These were the
        types of observations that ended up telling us that we know
        about matter, but fierce controversies ensued over whether
        these were themselves forms of matter.

        Let's bring ourselves up to the level of classification of
        phenomena employed by physicists in the year 1900. They
         recognized three categories:

        \begin{itemize}
        \item \index{matter!defined} \emph{Matter} has mass, can have kinetic
        energy, and can travel through a vacuum, transporting its
        mass and kinetic energy with it. Matter is conserved, both
        in the sense of conservation of mass and conservation of the
        number of atoms of each element. Atoms can't occupy the same
        space as other atoms, so a convenient way to prove something
        is not a form of matter is to show that it can pass through
        a solid material, in which the atoms are packed together closely.

        \item  \index{light!defined} \emph{Light} has no mass, always has energy,
        and can travel through a vacuum, transporting its energy
        with it. Two light beams can penetrate through each other
        and emerge from the collision without being weakened,
        deflected, or affected in any other way. Light can penetrate
        certain kinds of matter, e.g., glass.

        \item  The third category is everything that doesn't fit the
        definition of light or matter. This catch-all category
        includes, for example, time, velocity, heat, and force.
        \end{itemize}

        How would one find out what types of atoms there were?
        Today, it doesn't seem like it should have been very
        difficult to work out an experimental program to classify
        the types of atoms. For each type of atom, there should be a
        corresponding element, i.e., a pure substance made out of
        nothing but that type of atom. Atoms are supposed to be
        unsplittable, so a substance like milk could not possibly be
        elemental, since churning it vigorously causes it to split
        up into two separate substances: butter and whey. Similarly,
        rust could not be an element, because it can be made by
        combining two substances: iron and oxygen. Despite its
        apparent reasonableness, no such program was carried out
        until the eighteenth century. The ancients presumably did
        not do it because observation was not universally agreed on
        as the right way to answer questions about nature, and also
        because they lacked the necessary techniques or the
        techniques were the province of laborers with low social
        status, such as smiths and miners. 
        Alchemists were hindered by atomism's reputation for
        subversiveness, and by a tendency toward mysticism and
        secrecy. (The most celebrated challenge facing the
        alchemists, that of converting lead into gold, is one we now
        know to be impossible, since lead and gold are both elements.)

        By 1900, however, chemists had done a reasonably good job of
        finding out what the elements were. They also had determined
        the ratios of the different atoms' masses fairly accurately.
        A typical technique would be to measure how many grams of
        sodium (Na) would combine with one gram of chlorine (Cl) to
        make salt (NaCl). (This assumes you've already decided based
        on other evidence that salt consisted of equal numbers of Na
        and Cl atoms.) The masses of individual atoms, as opposed to
        the mass ratios, were known only to within a few orders of
        magnitude based on indirect evidence, and plenty of
        physicists and chemists denied that individual atoms were
        anything more than convenient symbols.

        As the information accumulated, the challenge was to find a
        way of systematizing it; the modern scientist's aesthetic
        sense rebels against complication. This hodgepodge of
        elements was an embarrassment. One contemporary observer,
        William \index{Crookes, William}Crookes, described the
        elements as extending ``before us as stretched the wide
        Atlantic before the gaze of Columbus, mocking, taunting and
        murmuring strange riddles, which no man has yet been able to
        solve.'' It wasn't long before people started recognizing
        that many atoms' masses were nearly integer multiples of the
        mass of hydrogen, the lightest element. A few excitable
        types began speculating that hydrogen was the basic building
        block, and that the heavier elements were made of clusters
        of hydrogen. It wasn't long, however, before their parade
        was rained on by more accurate measurements, which showed
        that not all of the elements had atomic masses that were
        near integer multiples of hydrogen, and even the ones that
        were close to being integer multiples were off by one percent or so.

        Chemistry professor Dmitri \index{Mendeleev, Dmitri}Mendeleev,
        preparing his lectures in 1869, wanted to find some way to
        organize his knowledge for his students to make it more
        understandable. He wrote the names of all the elements on
        cards and began arranging them in different ways on his
        desk, trying to find an arrangement that would make sense of
        the muddle. The row-and-column scheme he came up with is
        essentially our modern periodic table. The columns of the
        modern version represent groups of elements with similar
        chemical properties, and each row is more massive than the
        one above it. Going across each row, this almost always
        resulted in placing the atoms in sequence by weight as well.
        What made the system significant was its predictive value.
        There were three places where Mendeleev had to leave gaps in
        his checkerboard to keep chemically similar elements in the
        same column. He predicted that elements would exist to fill
        these gaps, and extrapolated or interpolated from other
        elements in the same column to predict their numerical
        properties, such as masses, boiling points, and densities.
        Mendeleev's professional stock skyrocketed when his three
        elements (later named gallium, scandium and germanium) were
        discovered and found to have very nearly the properties he had predicted.

        One thing that Mendeleev's table made clear was that mass
        was not the basic property that distinguished atoms of
        different elements. To make his table work, he had to
        deviate from ordering the elements strictly by mass. For
        instance, iodine atoms are lighter than tellurium, but
        Mendeleev had to put iodine after tellurium so that it would
        lie in a column with chemically similar elements.

        The success of the kinetic theory of heat was taken as
        strong evidence that, in addition to the motion of any
        object as a whole, there is an invisible type of motion all
        around us: the random motion of atoms within each object.
        But many conservatives were not convinced that atoms really
        existed. Nobody had ever seen one, after all. It wasn't
        until generations after the kinetic theory of heat was
        developed that it was demonstrated conclusively that atoms
        really existed and that they participated in continuous
        motion that never died out.

        The smoking gun to prove atoms were more than mathematical
        abstractions came when some old, obscure observations were
        reexamined by an unknown Swiss patent clerk named Albert
        Einstein. A botanist named \index{Brownian motion}Brown,
        using a microscope that was state of the art in 1827,
        observed tiny grains of pollen in a drop of water on a
        microscope slide, and found that they jumped around randomly
        for no apparent reason. Wondering at first if the pollen
        he'd assumed to be dead was actually alive, he tried looking
        at particles of soot, and found that the soot particles also
        moved around. The same results would occur with any small
        grain or particle suspended in a liquid. The phenomenon came
        to be referred to as Brownian motion, and its existence was
        filed away as a quaint and thoroughly unimportant fact,
        really just a nuisance for the microscopist.

        It wasn't until 1906 that \index{Einstein, Albert!and
        Brownian motion}Einstein found the correct interpretation
        for Brown's observation: the water molecules were in
        continuous random motion, and were colliding with the
        particle all the time, kicking it in random directions.
        After all the millennia of speculation about atoms, at last
        there was solid proof. Einstein's calculations dispelled all
        doubt, since he was able to make accurate predictions of
        things like the average distance traveled by the particle in
        a certain amount of time.  (Einstein received the Nobel
        Prize not for his theory of relativity but for his papers on
        Brownian motion and the photoelectric effect.)

        Proving that atoms actually existed was a big accomplishment,
        but demonstrating their existence was different from
        understanding their properties. Note that the Brown-Einstein
        observations had nothing at all to do with electricity, and
        yet we know that matter is inherently electrical, and we
        have been successful in interpreting certain electrical
        phenomena in terms of mobile positively and negatively
        charged particles. Are these particles atoms? Parts of
        atoms? Particles that are entirely separate from atoms? It
        is perhaps premature to attempt to answer these questions
        without any conclusive evidence in favor of the charged-particle
        model of electricity.

        Strong support for the charged-particle model came from a
        1911 experiment by physicist Robert \index{Millikan,
        Robert}Millikan at the University of Chicago. Consider a jet
        of droplets of perfume or some other liquid made by blowing
        it through a tiny pinhole. The droplets emerging from the
        pinhole must be smaller than the pinhole, and in fact most
        of them are even more microscopic than that, since the
        turbulent flow of air tends to break them up. Millikan
        reasoned that the droplets would acquire a little bit of
        electric charge as they rubbed against the channel through
        which they emerged, and if the charged-particle model of
        electricity was right, the charge might be split up among so
        many minuscule liquid drops that a single drop might have a
        total charge amounting to an excess of only a few charged
        particles --- perhaps an excess of one positive particle on
        a certain drop, or an excess of two negative ones on another.

        Millikan's ingenious apparatus, \figref{oildrop},
        consisted of two metal plates, which could be electrically
        charged as needed. He sprayed a cloud of oil droplets into
        the space between the plates, and selected one drop through
        a microscope for study. First, with no charge on the plates,
        he would determine the drop's mass by letting it fall
        through the air and measuring its terminal velocity, i.e.,
        the velocity at which the force of air friction canceled out
        the force of gravity. The force of air drag on a slowly
        moving sphere had already been found by experiment to be
        $bvr^2$, where $b$ was a constant.
        Setting the total force equal to zero when the drop is at
        terminal velocity gives
        \begin{equation*}
                   bvr^2 - mg = 0\eqquad,
        \end{equation*}
        and setting the known density of oil equal to the drop's
        mass divided by its volume gives a second equation,
        \begin{equation*}
                   \rho = \frac{m}{\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3}\eqquad.
        \end{equation*}
        Everything in these equations can be measured directly
        except for $m$ and $r$, so these are two equations in two
        unknowns, which can be solved in order to determine
        how big the drop is.

        Next Millikan charged the metal plates, adjusting the amount
        of charge so as to exactly counteract gravity and levitate
        the drop. If, for instance, the drop being examined happened
        to have a total charge that was negative, then positive
        charge put on the top plate would attract it, pulling it up,
        and negative charge on the bottom plate would repel it,
        pushing it up. (Theoretically only one plate would be
        necessary, but in practice a two-plate arrangement like this
        gave electrical forces that were more uniform in strength
        throughout the space where the oil drops were.) The amount
        of charge on the plates required to levitate the charged
        drop gave Millikan a handle on the amount of charge the drop
        carried. The more charge the drop had, the stronger the
        electrical forces on it would be, and the less charge would
        have to be put on the plates to do the trick. Unfortunately,
        expressing this relationship using Coulomb's law would have
        been impractical, because it would require a perfect
        knowledge of how the charge was distributed on each plate,
        plus the ability to perform vector addition of all the
        forces being exerted on the drop by all the charges on the
        plate. Instead, Millikan made use of the fact that the
        electrical force experienced by a pointlike charged object
        at a certain point in space is proportional to its charge,
        \begin{equation*}
                   \frac{F}{q} = \text{constant}\eqquad.
        \end{equation*}
        With a given amount of charge on the plates, this constant
        could be determined for instance by discarding the oil drop,
        inserting between the plates a larger and more easily
        handled object with a known charge on it, and measuring the
        force with conventional methods. (Millikan actually used a
        slightly different set of techniques for determining the
        constant, but the concept is the same.) The amount of force
        on the actual oil drop had to equal $mg$, since it was
        just enough to levitate it, and once the calibration
        constant had been determined, the charge of the drop could
        then be found based on its previously determined mass.

<% end_marg %>
        The table on the left shows a few of the results from
        Millikan's 1911 paper. (Millikan took data on both
        negatively and positively charged drops, but in his paper he
        gave only a sample of his data on negatively charged drops,
        so these numbers are all negative.) Even a quick look at the
        data leads to the suspicion that the charges are not simply
        a series of random numbers. For instance, the second charge
        is almost exactly equal to half the first one. Millikan
        explained the observed charges as all being integer
        multiples of a single number, $1.64\times10^{-19}$ C. In the
        second column, dividing by this constant gives numbers that
        are essentially integers, allowing for the random errors
        present in the experiment. Millikan states in his paper that
        these results were a

        \begin{quote}
        \ldots direct and tangible demonstration \ldots of the correctness of
        the view advanced many years ago and supported by evidence
        from many sources that all electrical charges, however
        produced, are exact multiples of one definite, elementary
        electrical charge, or in other words, that an electrical
        charge instead of being spread uniformly over the charged
        surface has a definite granular structure, consisting, in
        fact, of \ldots specks, or atoms of electricity, all precisely
        alike, peppered over the surface of the charged body.
        \end{quote}

        In other words, he had provided direct evidence for the
        charged-particle model of electricity and against models in
        which electricity was described as some sort of fluid. The
        basic charge is notated $e$, and the modern value is
        $e=1.60\times10^{-19}$ C.
        The word ``\emph{quantized}'' is used in physics to describe
        a quantity that can only have certain numerical values, and
        cannot have any of the values between those. In this
        language, we would say that Millikan discovered that charge
        is quantized. The charge $e$ is referred to as the quantum of charge.

        <% begin_sec("A historical note on Millikan's fraud") %>
        Very few undergraduate physics textbooks mention
         the well-documented fact that although
        Millikan's conclusions were correct, he was guilty of scientific
        fraud. His technique was difficult and painstaking to perform, and his
        original notebooks, which have been preserved, show that the data were
        far less perfect than he claimed in his published scientific papers.
        In his publications, he stated categorically that every single oil
        drop observed had had a charge that was a multiple of $e$, with no
        exceptions or omissions. But his notebooks are replete with notations
        such as ``beautiful data, keep,'' and ``bad run, throw out.'' Millikan,

        position with dishonest descriptions of his data.
        
        Why do textbook
        authors fail to mention Millikan's fraud? It may be that they think
        students are too unsophisticated to correctly evaluate the
        implications of the fact that scientific fraud has sometimes existed
        and even been rewarded by the scientific establishment. Maybe they are
        afraid students will reason that fudging data is OK, since Millikan
        got the Nobel Prize for it. But falsifying history in the name of
        encouraging truthfulness is more than a little ironic. English

        are always punished and the good ones never suffer!

        Nineteenth-century physicists spent a lot of
        time trying to come up with wild, random ways to play with
        electricity. The best experiments of this kind were the ones
        that made big sparks or pretty colors of light.

        One such parlor trick was the cathode ray. To produce it,
        you first had to hire a good glassblower and find a good
        vacuum pump. The glassblower would create a hollow tube and
        embed two pieces of metal in it, called the electrodes,
        which were connected to the outside via metal wires passing
        through the glass. Before letting him seal up the whole
        tube, you would hook it up to a vacuum pump, and spend
        several hours huffing and puffing away at the pump's hand
        crank to get a good vacuum inside. Then, while you were
        still pumping on the tube, the glassblower  would melt the
        glass and seal the whole thing shut. Finally, you would put
        a large amount of positive charge on one wire and a large
        amount of negative charge on the other. Metals have the
        property of letting charge move through them easily, so the
        charge deposited on one of the wires would quickly spread
        out because of the repulsion of each part of it for every
        other part. This spreading-out process would result in
        nearly all the charge ending up in the electrodes, where
        there is more room to spread out than there is in the wire.
        For obscure historical reasons a negative electrode is
        called a cathode and a positive one is an anode.

        Figure \figref{crt} shows the light-emitting stream that was
        observed. If, as shown in this figure, a hole was made in
        the anode, the beam would extend on through the hole until
        it hit the glass. Drilling a hole in the cathode, however
        would not result in any beam coming out on the left side,
        and this indicated that the stuff, whatever it was, was
        coming from the cathode. The rays were therefore christened
        ``cathode rays.'' (The terminology is still used today in
        the term ``cathode ray tube'' or ``CRT'' for the picture
        tube of a TV or computer monitor.)

<% end_sec() %>
<% begin_sec("Were cathode rays a form of light, or of matter?") %>

        Were cathode rays a form of light, or matter? At first no
        one really cared what they were, but as their scientific
        importance became more apparent, the light-versus-matter
        issue turned into a controversy along nationalistic lines,
        with the Germans advocating light and the English holding
        out for matter. The supporters of the material interpretation
        imagined the rays as consisting of a stream of atoms ripped
        from the substance of the cathode.

        One of our defining characteristics of matter is that
        material objects cannot pass through each other. Experiments
        showed that cathode rays could penetrate at least some small
        thickness of matter, such as a metal foil a tenth of a
        millimeter thick, implying that they were a form of light.

        Other experiments, however, pointed to the contrary
        conclusion. Light is a wave phenomenon, and one distinguishing
        property of waves is demonstrated by speaking into one end of a
        paper towel roll. The sound waves do not emerge from the
        other end of the tube as a focused beam. Instead, they begin
        spreading out in all directions as soon as they emerge. This
        shows that waves do not necessarily travel in straight
        lines. If a piece of metal foil in the shape of a star or a
        cross was placed in the way of the cathode ray, then a
        ``shadow'' of the same shape would appear on the glass,
        showing that the rays traveled in straight lines. This
        straight-line motion suggested that they were a stream of
        small particles of matter.  

        These observations were inconclusive, so what was really
        needed was a determination of whether the rays had mass and
        weight. The trouble was that cathode rays could not simply
        be collected in a cup and put on a scale. When the cathode
        ray tube is in operation, one does not observe any loss of
        material from the cathode, or any crust being deposited on the anode.

         Nobody could think of a good way to weigh cathode rays, so
        the next most obvious way of settling the light/matter
        debate was to check whether the cathode rays possessed
        electrical charge. Light was known to be uncharged. If the
        cathode rays carried charge, they were definitely matter and
        not light, and they were presumably being made to jump the
        gap by the simultaneous repulsion of the negative charge in
        the cathode and attraction of the positive charge in the
        anode. The rays would overshoot the anode because of their
        momentum. (Although electrically charged particles do not
        normally leap across a gap of vacuum, very large amounts of
        charge were being used, so the forces were unusually intense.)

<% end_marg %>
        Physicist J.J.~Thomson at Cambridge carried out a series of
        definitive experiments on cathode rays around the year 1897.
        By turning them slightly off course with electrical forces, \figref{deflect},
        he showed that they were indeed
        electrically charged, which was strong evidence that they
        were material. Not only that, but he proved that they had
        mass, and measured the ratio of their mass to their charge,
        $m/q$. Since their mass was not zero, he concluded that they
        were a form of matter, and presumably made up of a stream of
        microscopic, negatively charged particles. When Millikan
        published his results fourteen years later, it was
        reasonable to assume that the charge of one such particle
        equaled minus one fundamental charge, $q=-e$, and from the
        combination of Thomson's and Millikan's results one could
        therefore determine the mass of a single cathode ray particle.

  )
%>

        The basic technique for determining $m/q$ was simply to
        measure the angle through which the charged plates bent the
        beam. The electric force acting on a cathode ray particle
        while it was between the plates would be proportional to its charge,
        \begin{equation*}
                        F_{elec}        = \text{(known constant)} \cdot q\eqquad.  
        \end{equation*}

        Application of Newton's second law, $a=F/m$, would allow
        $m/q$ to be determined:

        \begin{equation*}
                        \frac{m}{q}        =      \frac{\text{known constant}}{a}
        \end{equation*}

        There was just one catch. Thomson needed to know the cathode
        ray particles' velocity in order to figure out their
        acceleration. At that point, however, nobody had even an
        educated guess as to the speed of the cathode rays produced
        in a given vacuum tube. The beam appeared to leap across the
        vacuum tube practically instantaneously, so it was no simple
        matter of timing it with a stopwatch!

        Thomson's clever solution was to observe the effect of both
        electric and magnetic forces on the beam. The magnetic force
        exerted by a particular magnet would depend on both the
        cathode ray's charge and its velocity:
        \begin{equation*}
                        F_{mag}        =      \text{(known constant \#2)} \cdot qv
        \end{equation*}

        Thomson played with the electric and magnetic forces until
        either one would produce an equal effect on the beam,
        allowing him to solve for the velocity,

        \begin{equation*}
                        v    =     \frac{\text{(known constant)}}{\text{(known constant \#2)}}\eqquad.  
        \end{equation*}

        Knowing the velocity (which was on the order of 10\% of the
        speed of light for his setup), he was able to find the
        acceleration and thus the mass-to-charge ratio $m/q$.
        Thomson's techniques were relatively crude (or perhaps more
        charitably we could say that they stretched the state of the
        art of the time), so with various methods he came up with
        $m/q$ values that ranged over about a factor of two, even
        for cathode rays extracted from a cathode made of a single
        material. The best modern value is
        $m/q=5.69\times10^{-12}$ kg/C, which is consistent with the low
        end of Thomson's range.

<% end_sec() %>
<% begin_sec("The cathode ray as a subatomic particle: the electron") %>\index{electron}

        What was significant about Thomson's experiment was not the
        actual numerical value of $m/q$, however, so much as the
        fact that, combined with Millikan's value of the fundamental
        charge, it gave a mass for the cathode ray particles that
        was thousands of times smaller than the mass of even the
        lightest atoms. Even without Millikan's results, which were
        14 years in the future, Thomson recognized that the cathode
        rays' $m/q$ was thousands of times smaller than the
        $m/q$ ratios that had been measured for electrically charged
        atoms in chemical solutions. He correctly interpreted this
        as evidence that the cathode rays were smaller building
        blocks --- he called them \emph{electrons} --- out of which
        atoms themselves were formed. This was an extremely radical
        claim, coming at a time when atoms had not yet been proven
        to exist! Even those who used the word ``atom'' often
        considered them no more than mathematical abstractions, not
        literal objects. The idea of searching for structure inside
        of ``unsplittable'' atoms was seen by some as lunacy, but
        within ten years Thomson's ideas had been amply verified by
        many more detailed experiments.

\startdqs

\begin{dq}
        Thomson started to become convinced during his experiments
        that the ``cathode rays'' observed coming from the cathodes
        of vacuum tubes were building blocks of atoms --- what we
        now call electrons. He then carried out observations with
        cathodes made of a variety of metals, and found that $m/q$
        was roughly the same in every case, considering his limited
        accuracy. Given his suspicion, why did it make sense to try
        different metals? How would the consistent values of $m/q$
        serve to test his hypothesis?
\end{dq}
 % 
\begin{dq}
        My students have frequently asked whether the $m/q$ that
        Thomson measured was the value for a single electron, or for
        the whole beam. Can you answer this question?
\end{dq}
 % 
\begin{dq}
        Thomson found that the $m/q$ of an electron was thousands
        of times smaller than that of charged atoms in chemical
        solutions. Would this imply that the electrons had more
        charge? Less mass? Would there be no way to tell? Explain.
        Remember that Millikan's results were still many years in
        the future, so $q$ was unknown.
\end{dq}
 % 
\begin{dq}
        Can you guess any practical reason why Thomson couldn't
        just let one electron fly across the gap before disconnecting
        the battery and turning off the beam, and then measure the
        amount of charge deposited on the anode, thus allowing him
        to measure the charge of a single electron directly?
\end{dq}
 % 
\begin{dq}
        Why is it not possible to determine $m$ and $q$
        themselves, rather than just their ratio, by observing
        electrons' motion in electric and magnetic fields?

        Based on his experiments, Thomson proposed a picture of the
        atom which became known as the \index{atom!raisin-cookie
        model of}\index{raisin cookie model}raisin cookie model.
        In the neutral atom, \figref{raisincookie}, there are four
        electrons with a total charge of $-4e$, sitting in a sphere
        (the ``cookie'') with a charge of $+4e$ spread throughout
        it. It was known that chemical reactions could not change
        one element into another, so in Thomson's scenario, each
        element's cookie sphere had a permanently fixed radius,
        mass, and positive charge, different from those of other
        elements. The electrons, however, were not a permanent
        feature of the atom, and could be tacked on or pulled out to
        make charged ions. Although we now know, for instance, that
        a neutral atom with four electrons is the element beryllium,
        scientists at the time did not know how many electrons the
        various neutral atoms possessed.

        This model is clearly different from the one you've learned
        in grade school or through popular culture, where the
        positive charge is concentrated in a tiny nucleus at the
        atom's center. An equally important change in ideas about
        the atom has been the realization that atoms and their
        constituent subatomic particles behave entirely differently
        from objects on the human scale. For instance, we'll see
        later that an electron can be in more than one place at one
        time. The raisin cookie model was part of a long tradition
        of attempts to make mechanical models of phenomena, and
        Thomson and his contemporaries never questioned the
        appropriateness of building a mental model of an atom as a
        machine with little parts inside. Today, mechanical models
        of atoms are still used (for instance the tinker-toy-style
        molecular modeling kits like the ones used by Watson and
        Crick to figure out the double helix structure of DNA), but
        scientists realize that the physical objects are only aids
        to help our brains' symbolic and visual processes think about atoms.

        Although there was no clear-cut experimental evidence for
        many of the details of the raisin cookie model, physicists
        went ahead and started working out its implications. For
        instance, suppose you had a four-electron atom. All four
        electrons would be repelling each other, but they would also
        all be attracted toward the center of the ``cookie'' sphere.
        The result should be some kind of stable, symmetric
        arrangement in which all the forces canceled out. People
        sufficiently clever with math soon showed that the electrons
        in a four-electron atom should settle down at the vertices
        of a pyramid with one less side than the Egyptian kind, i.e.,
        a regular tetrahedron. This deduction turns out to be wrong
        because it was based on incorrect features of the model, but
        the model also had many successes, a few of which we will now discuss.

\begin{eg}{Flow of electrical charge in wires}
                One of my former students was the son of an electrician, and
        had become an electrician himself. He related to me how his
        father had remained refused to believe all his life that
        electrons really flowed through wires. If they had, he
        reasoned, the metal would have gradually become more and
        more damaged, eventually crumbling to dust.

                His opinion is not at all unreasonable based on the fact
        that electrons are material particles, and that matter
        cannot normally pass through matter without making a hole
        through it. Nineteenth-century physicists would have shared
        his objection to a charged-particle model of the flow of
        electrical charge. In the raisin-cookie model, however,
        the electrons are very low in mass, and therefore presumably
        very small in size as well. It is not surprising that they
        can slip between the atoms without damaging them.
\end{eg}
\begin{eg}{Flow of electrical charge across cell membranes}
                Your nervous system is based on signals carried by charge
        moving from nerve cell to nerve cell. Your body is
        essentially all liquid, and atoms in a liquid are mobile.
        This means that, unlike the case of charge flowing in a
        solid wire, entire charged atoms can flow in your nervous system
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Emission of electrons in a cathode ray tube}
                Why do electrons detach themselves from the cathode of a
        vacuum tube? Certainly they are encouraged to do so by the
        repulsion of the negative charge placed on the cathode and
        the attraction from the net positive charge of the anode,
        but these are not strong enough to rip electrons out of
        atoms by main force --- if they were, then the entire
        apparatus would have been instantly vaporized as every atom
        was simultaneously ripped apart!

                The raisin cookie model leads to a simple explanation. We
        know that heat is the energy of random motion of atoms. The
        atoms in any object are therefore violently jostling each
        other all the time, and a few of these collisions are
        violent enough to knock electrons out of atoms. If this
        occurs near the surface of a solid object, the electron may
        can come loose. Ordinarily, however, this loss of electrons
        is a self-limiting process; the loss of electrons leaves the
        object with a net positive charge, which attracts the lost
        sheep home to the fold. (For objects immersed in air rather
        than vacuum, there will also be a balanced exchange of
        electrons between the air and the object.)

                This interpretation explains the warm and friendly yellow
        glow of the vacuum tubes in an antique radio. To encourage
        the emission of electrons from the vacuum tubes' cathodes,
        the cathodes are intentionally warmed up with little heater coils.
