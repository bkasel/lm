In the martial arts movie \emph{Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon},
those who had received mystical enlightenment are able to violate the
laws of physics. Some of the violations are obvious, such as their ability
to fly, but others are a little more subtle. The rebellious young
heroine/antiheroine Jen Yu gets into an argument while sitting
at a table in a restaurant. A young tough, Iron Arm Lu, comes running toward her at full
speed, and she puts up one arm and effortlessly makes him bounce
back, without even getting out of her seat or bracing herself against
anything. She does all this between bites.

\label{pconsproof1d}
Although kinetic energy doesn't depend on the direction of motion,
we've already seen on page \pageref{subsec:predictingdirection} how
conservation of energy combined with Galilean relativity allows us to
make some predictions about the direction of motion. One of the examples
was a demonstration that it isn't possible for a hockey puck to
spontaneously reverse its direction of motion. In the scene from the
movie, however, the woman's assailant isn't just gliding through
space. He's interacting with her, so the previous argument doesn't 
apply here, and we need to generalize it to more than
one object.
We consider the case of a physical system composed of pointlike material
particles, in which every particle interacts with every other particle
through an energy $U(r)$ that depends only on the distance $r$ between them.
This still allows for a fairly general \emph{mechanical system},\index{mechanical system}
by which I mean roughly a system made of matter, not light.
The characters
in the movie are made of protons, neutrons, and electrons, so they
would constitute such a system if the interactions among all these
particles were of the form $U(r)$.\footnote{Electrical and magnetic interactions
\emph{don't} quite behave like this, which is a point we'll take up
later in the book.} We might even be able to get away with thinking of each person
as one big particle, if it's a good approximation to say that
every part of each person's whole body moves in the same
direction at the same speed.

The basic insight can be extracted from the special case where there
are only two particles interacting, and they only move in one dimension,
as in the example shown in figure \figref{poolballs}.
Conservation of energy says
\begin{equation*}
        K_{1i}+K_{2i}+U_i = K_{1f}+K_{2f}+U_f\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
For simplicity, let's assume that the interactions start after the time we're calling
initial, and end before the instant we choose as final. This is true 
in figure \figref{poolballs}, for example. Then $U_i=U_f$, and we can subtract the
interaction energies from both sides, giving.
\begin{align*}
        K_{1i}+K_{2i} &= K_{1f}+K_{2f}  \\
        \frac{1}{2}m_1v_{1i}^2+\frac{1}{2}m_2v_{2i}^2 
                        &= \frac{1}{2}m_1v_{1f}^2+\frac{1}{2}m_2v_{2f}^2\eqquad.
\end{align*}
As in the one-particle argument on page  \pageref{subsec:predictingdirection}, the
trick is to require conservation of energy not just in one particular frame of reference,
but in every frame of reference. In a frame of reference moving at velocity $u$
relative to the first one, the velocities all have $u$ added onto them:\footnote{We 
can now see that the derivation would
have been equally valid for $U_i\ne U_f$. The two observers agree
on the distance between the particles, so they also agree on the interaction energies,
even though they disagree on the kinetic energies.}
\begin{multline*}
                \frac{1}{2}m_1(v_{1i}+u)^2+\frac{1}{2}m_2(v_{2i}+u)^2 
                        = \frac{1}{2}m_1(v_{1f}+u)^2+\frac{1}{2}m_2(v_{2f}+u)^2 
\end{multline*}
When we square a quantity like $(v_{1i}+u)^2$, we get the same $v_{1i}^2$ that
occurred in the original frame of reference, plus two $u$-dependent terms,
$2v_{1i}u+u^2$. Subtracting the original conservation of energy equation
from the  version in the new frame of reference, we have
\begin{align*}
        m_1v_{1i}u+m_2v_{2i}u = m_1v_{1f}u+m_2v_{2f}u\eqquad, \\
        \intertext{or, dividing by $u$,}
        m_1v_{1i}+m_2v_{2i} = m_1v_{1f}+m_2v_{2f}\eqquad.
\end{align*}
This is a statement that when you add up $mv$ for the whole
system, that total remains constant over time. In other words, this is a conservation law.
The quantity $mv$ is called \emph{momentum}\index{momentum}, notated
$p$ for obscure historical reasons. Its units are $\kgunit\cdot\munit/\sunit$.

              Velocities are shown with arrows. The second observer is moving to the left at velocity

Unlike kinetic energy, momentum depends on the direction of motion, since the
velocity is not squared. In one dimension, motion in the same direction as the
positive $x$ axis is represented with positive values of $v$ and $p$. 
Motion in the opposite direction has negative $v$ and $p$.

\begin{eg}{Jen Yu meets Iron Arm Lu}
        \egquestion
        Initially, Jen Yu is at rest, and Iron Arm Lu is charging to the left, toward her,
        at 5 m/s. Jen Yu's mass is 50 kg, and Lu's is 100 kg. After the collision,
        the movie shows Jen Yu still at rest, and Lu rebounding at 5 m/s to the right.
        Is this consistent with the laws of physics, or would it be impossible in real
        life?

        \eganswer
        This is perfectly consistent with conservation of mass (50 kg+100 kg=50 kg+100 kg),
        and also with conservation of energy, since neither person's kinetic energy changes,
        and there is therefore no change in the total energy. (We don't have to worry about
        interaction energies, because the two points in time we're considering are ones at
        which the two people aren't interacting.)
        To analyze whether the scene violates conservation of momentum, we have to pick a
        coordinate system. Let's define positive as being to the right.
        The initial momentum is
        (50 kg)(0 m/s)+(100 kg)($-$5 m/s)=$-$500 $\kgunit\cdot\munit/\sunit$, and the final
        momentum is (50 kg)(0 m/s)+(100 kg)(5 m/s)=500 $\kgunit\cdot\munit/\sunit$.
        This is a change of 1000 $\kgunit\cdot\munit/\sunit$, which is impossible if
        the two people constitute a closed system.

        One could argue that they're not
        a closed system, since Lu might be exchanging momentum with the floor, and
        Jen Yu might be exchanging momentum with the seat of her chair. This is
        a reasonable objection, but in the following section we'll see that there are
        physical reasons why, in this situation, the force of
        friction would be relatively weak, and would not be able
        to transfer that much momentum in a fraction of a second.
\end{eg}

This example points to an intuitive interpretation of conservation of momentum,
which is that interactions are always mutual. That is, Jen Yu can't change Lu's
momentum without having her own momentum changed as well.

\begin{eg}{A cannon}
        \egquestion
        A cannon of mass 1000 kg fires a 10-kg shell at a
        velocity of 200 m/s. At what speed does the cannon recoil?

        \eganswer
        The law of conservation of momentum tells us that
        \begin{equation*}
                 p_{cannon,i} +  p_{shell,i} 
                        =  p_{cannon,f} +  p_{shell,f}\eqquad.
        \end{equation*}
        Choosing a coordinate system in which the cannon points in
        the positive direction, the given information is
        \begin{align*}
                 p_{cannon,i}  &= 0 \\
                 p_shell,i   &= 0 \\
                 p_{shell,f}  &= 2000\ \zu{kg}\cdot\zu{m/s}\eqquad.
        \end{align*}
        We must have $p_{cannon,f}=-\zu{2000 kg}\cdot\zu{m/s}$, so the recoil velocity
        of the cannon is 2 m/s.

        \egquestion
         The experimental solar-powered ion drive of the
        Deep Space 1 space probe expels its xenon gas exhaust at a
        speed of 30,000 m/s, ten times faster than the exhaust
        velocity for a typical chemical-fuel rocket engine. Roughly
        how many times greater is the maximum speed this spacecraft
        can reach, compared with a chemical-fueled probe with the
        same mass of fuel (``reaction mass'') available for pushing
        out the back as exhaust?

        \eganswer
        Momentum equals mass multiplied by velocity. Both
        spacecraft are assumed to have the same amount of reaction
        mass, and the ion drive's exhaust has a velocity ten times
        greater, so the momentum of its exhaust is ten times
        greater. Before the engine starts firing, neither the probe
        nor the exhaust has any momentum, so the total momentum of
        the system is zero. By conservation of momentum, the total
        momentum must also be zero after all the exhaust has been
        expelled. If we define the positive direction as the
        direction the spacecraft is going, then the negative
        momentum of the exhaust is canceled by the positive momentum
        of the spacecraft. The ion drive allows a final speed that
        is ten times greater. (This simplified analysis ignores the
        fact that the reaction mass expelled later in the burn is
        not moving backward as fast, because of the forward speed of
        the already-moving spacecraft.)

        So far, it sounds as though conservation of momentum can be proved mathematically,
        unlike conservation of mass and energy, which are entirely based on observations.
        The proof, however, was only for a mechanical system, with
        interactions of the form $U(r)$. Conservation of momentum can be extended to
        other systems as well, but this generalization is based on experiments, not
        mathematical proof. Light is the most important example of momentum that doesn't
        equal $mv$ --- light doesn't have mass at all, but it does have momentum. For
        example, a flashlight left on for an hour would absorb about
        $10^{-5}\ \kgunit\cdot\munit/\sunit$ of momentum as it recoiled.\index{light!momentum of}
        \index{momentum!of light}

\begin{eg}{Halley's comet}\index{Halley's comet}\index{comet}
        Momentum is not always equal to $mv$. Halley's comet, shown
        in figure \figref{halley}, has a very elongated elliptical orbit, like those of
        many other comets. About once per century, its orbit brings
        it close to the sun. The comet's head, or nucleus, is
        composed of dirty ice, so the energy deposited by the
        intense sunlight gradually removes ice from the surface and turns it into water vapor. The bottom photo
        shows a view of the water coming off of the nucleus from
        the European Giotto space probe, which passed within 596 km
        of the comet's head on March 13, 1986.

        The sunlight does not
        just carry energy, however. It also carries momentum. Once
        the steam comes off, the momentum of the sunlight impacting
        on it pushes it away from the sun, forming a tail as shown
        in in the top image.
        The tail always points away from the sun, so when the comet is
        receding from the sun, the tail is in front.
        By analogy with matter, for which momentum equals $mv$, you
        would expect that massless light would have zero momentum,
        but the equation $p= mv$ is not the correct one for light, and
        light does have momentum. (Some comets also have a second
        tail, which is propelled by electrical forces rather than by
        the momentum of sunlight.)

        The reason for bringing this up is not so that you can
        plug numbers into formulas in these exotic situations.
        The point is that the conservation laws have proven so
        sturdy exactly because they can easily be amended to fit
        new circumstances. The momentum of light will be a natural consequence
        of the discussion of the theory of relativity in chapter \ref{ch:rel}.

Momentum and kinetic energy are both measures of the
quantity of motion, and a sideshow in the Newton-Leibniz
controversy over who invented calculus was an argument over
whether $mv$ (i.e., momentum) or $mv^2$ (i.e., kinetic energy
without the 1/2 in front) was the ``true'' measure of motion.
The modern student can certainly be excused for wondering
why we need both quantities, when their complementary nature
was not evident to the greatest minds of the 1700s. The
following table highlights their differences.

A tuning fork is made with two prongs so that they can vibrate in opposite directions,

the hand holding the fork. The result would be that vibrations would be transmitted
to the hand and rapidly die out. In a two-prong fork, the two momenta cancel, but the
energies don't.

        gains some momentum in the forward direction, but this is
        canceled by the rifle's backward momentum, so the total
        momentum is still zero. The kinetic energies of the gun and
        bullet are both positive numbers, however, and do not
        cancel. The total kinetic energy is allowed to increase,
        because kinetic energy is being traded for other forms of
        energy. Initially there is chemical energy in the gunpowder.
        This chemical energy is converted into heat, sound, and

        conservation of momentum in the closed earth-moon system
        tells us that the earth must also reverse its momentum. In
        fact, the earth wobbles in a little ``orbit'' about a point
        below its surface on the line connecting it and the moon.
        The two bodies' momenta always point in opposite

        Physicists employ the term ``collision'' in a broader sense
        than in ordinary usage, applying it to any situation where
        objects interact for a certain period of time. A bat hitting
        a baseball, a cosmic ray damaging DNA,
        and a gun and a bullet going their separate ways are all
        examples of collisions in this sense. Physical contact is
        not even required. A comet swinging past the sun on a
        hyperbolic orbit is considered to undergo a collision, even
        though it never touches the sun. All that matters is that
        the comet and the sun interacted gravitationally with each
        other.

The reason for broadening the term ``collision'' in this way
is that all of these situations can be attacked
mathematically using the same conservation laws in similar
ways. In our first example, conservation of momentum is all
that is required.

hit Ms.\ Chang. She thinks he was going much faster than
that. The cars skidded together after the impact, and
measurements of the length of the skid marks show that their joint velocity
immediately after the impact was 30 km per hour. Mr.\
Nelson's Nissan has a mass of 1400 kg, and Ms.\ Chang 's
Cadillac is 2400 kg. Is Mr.\ Nelson telling the
truth?

\eganswer
Since the cars skidded together, we can write down
the equation for conservation of momentum using only two
velocities, $v$ for Mr.\ Nelson's velocity before the crash,
and $v'$ for their joint velocity afterward:
\begin{equation*}
         m_{N} v =  m_{N} v' + m_{C} v'\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Solving for the unknown, $v$, we find
\begin{align*}
         v &=  \left(1+\frac{ m_C}{ m_{N}}\right) v' \\
                &= \zu{80\ km/hr}\eqquad.
\end{align*}
He is lying.
\end{eg}

The above example was simple because both cars had the same
velocity afterward. In many one-dimensional collisions,
however, the two objects do not stick. If we wish to predict
the result of such a collision, conservation of momentum
does not suffice, because both velocities after the
collision are unknown, so we have one equation in two
unknowns.

Conservation of energy can provide a second equation, but
its application is not as straightforward, because kinetic
energy is only the particular form of energy that has to do
with motion. In many collisions, part of the kinetic energy
that was present before the collision is used to create heat
or sound, or to break the objects or permanently bend
them. Cars, in fact, are carefully designed to crumple in a
collision. Crumpling the car uses up energy, and that's good
because the goal is to get rid of all that kinetic energy in
a relatively safe and controlled way. At the opposite
extreme, a superball is ``super'' because it emerges from a
collision with almost all its original kinetic energy,
having only stored it briefly as interatomic electrical energy while it
was being squashed by the impact.

        Collisions of the superball type, in which almost no kinetic
        energy is converted to other forms of energy, can thus be
        analyzed more thoroughly, because they have $K_f=K_i$, as
        opposed to the less useful inequality $K_f<K_i$ for a case
        like a tennis ball bouncing on grass.\label{elastic-and-inelastic}
These two types of collisions are referred to, respectively, as elastic
and inelastic.\index{collision!elastic}\index{collision!inelastic}
The extreme inelastic case is discussed further on p.~\pageref{subsec:totally-inelastic}.

\egquestion Two pool balls collide head-on, so that the
collision is restricted to one dimension. Pool balls are
constructed so as to lose as little kinetic energy as
possible in a collision, so under the assumption that no
kinetic energy is converted to any other form of energy,

The equation $A+B = C+D$ says that
the change in one ball's velocity is
equal and opposite to the change
in the other's. We invent a symbol
$x=C-A$ for the change in ball 1's velocity. The second equation can
then be rewritten as
$A^2+B^2 = (A+x)^2+(B-x)^2$.
Squaring out the quantities in parentheses and then simplifying, we get
$0 = Ax-Bx+x^2$.
The equation has the trivial solution $x=0$, i.e., neither ball's velocity
is changed, but this is physically
impossible because the balls can't travel through each other like
ghosts. Assuming $x\ne 0$, we can divide by $x$ and solve for $x=B-A$. This
means that ball 1 has gained an
amount of velocity exactly sufficient to mat\-ch ball 2's
initial velocity, and vice-versa. The
balls must have swap\-ped velocities.

\eganswer Pool balls have identical masses, so we use the
same symbol $m$ for both. Conservation of energy and no loss
of kinetic energy give us the two equations
\begin{align*}
  mv_{1i}+mv_{2i} &=  mv_{1f}+mv_{2f} \\
  \frac{1}{2}mv_{1i}^2+\frac{1}{2}mv_{2i}^2 &=  \frac{1}{2}mv_{1f}^2+\frac{1}{2}mv_{2f}^2
\end{align*}
The masses and the factors of 1/2 can be divided out, and we
eliminate the cumbersome subscripts by replacing the symbols
$v_{1i}$,... with the symbols $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$:
\begin{align*}
 A+B &= C+D \\
 A^2+B^2 &= C^2+D^2\eqquad.
\end{align*}
A little experimentation with numbers shows that given
values of $A$ and $B$, it is impossible to find $C$ and $D$
that satisfy these equations unless $C$ and $D$ equal $A$
and $B$, or $C$ and $D$ are the same as $A$ and $B$ but
swapped around. A formal proof of this fact is given in the
sidebar.
In the special case where ball 2 is initially at
rest, this tells us that ball 1 is stopped dead by the
collision, and ball 2 heads off at the velocity originally
possessed by ball 1. This behavior will be familiar to players of pool.
\end{eg}

Often, as in example \ref{eg:pool-balls}, the details of the algebra
are the least interesting part of the problem, and
considerable physical insight can be gained simply by
counting the number of unknowns and comparing to the number
of equations. Suppose a beginner at pool notices a case
where her cue ball hits an initially stationary ball and
stops dead. ``Wow, what a good trick,'' she thinks. ``I bet I
could never do that again in a million years.'' But she tries
again, and finds that she can't help doing it even if she
doesn't want to. Luckily she has just learned about
collisions in her physics course. Once she has written down
the equations for conservation of momentum and no loss of
kinetic energy, she really doesn't have to complete the
algebra. She knows that she has two equations in two
unknowns, so there must be a well-defined solution. Once she
has seen the result of one such collision, she knows that
the same thing must happen every time. The same thing would
happen with colliding marbles or croquet balls. It doesn't
matter if the masses or velocities are different, because
that just multiplies both equations by some constant factor.

        
<% begin_sec("The discovery of the neutron") %>
\label{chadwick-as-example-of-collision}
        This was the type of reasoning employed by James Chadwick\index{Chadwick, James}\index{neutron!discovery of}
        in his 1932 discovery of the neutron. At the time, the atom was
        imagined to be made out of two types of fundamental
        particles, protons and electrons. The protons were far more
        massive, and clustered together in the atom's core, or
        nucleus. Electrical attraction caused the electrons
        to orbit the nucleus in circles, in much the same way that
        gravity kept the planets from cruising out of
        the solar system. Experiments showed, for example,
        that twice as much energy was required to strip the last
        electron off of a helium atom as was needed to remove the
        single electron from a hydrogen atom,
        and this was explained by saying that
        helium had two protons to hydrogen's one. The trouble was
        that according to this model, helium would have two
        electrons and two protons, giving it precisely twice the
        mass of a hydrogen atom with one of each. In fact, helium
        has about four times the mass of hydrogen.

Chadwick suspected that the helium nucleus possessed two
additional particles of a new type, which did not
participate in electrical interactions at all, i.e., were
electrically neutral. If these particles had very nearly the
same mass as protons, then the four-to-one mass ratio of
helium and hydrogen could be explained.  In 1930, a new type
of radiation was discovered that seemed to fit this
description. It was electrically neutral, and seemed to be
coming from the nuclei of light elements that had been
exposed to other types of radiation. At this time, however,
reports of new types of particles were a dime a dozen, and
most of them turned out to be either clusters made of
previously known particles or else previously known
particles with higher energies. Many physicists believed
that the ``new'' particle that had attracted Chadwick's
interest was really a previously known particle called a
gamma ray, which was electrically neutral. Since gamma rays
have no mass, Chadwick decided to try to determine the new
particle's mass and see if it was nonzero and approximately
equal to the mass of a proton.

      Chadwick's subatomic pool table. A disk of the naturally
              occurring metal polonium provides a source of radiation
              capable of kicking neutrons out of the beryllium nuclei. The
              type of radiation emitted by the polonium is easily absorbed
              by a few mm of air, so the air has to be pumped out of the
              left-hand chamber. The neutrons, Chadwick's mystery
              particles, penetrate matter far more readily, and fly out
              through the wall and into the chamber on the right, which is
              filled with nitrogen or hydrogen gas. When a neutron
              collides with a nitrogen or hydrogen nucleus, it kicks it
              out of its atom at high speed, and this recoiling nucleus
              then rips apart thousands of other atoms of the gas. The
              result is an electrical pulse that can be detected in the
              wire on the right. Physicists had already calibrated this
              type of apparatus so that they could translate the strength
              of the electrical pulse into the velocity of the recoiling
              nucleus. The whole apparatus shown in the figure would fit

Unfortunately a subatomic particle is not something you can
just put on a scale and weigh. Chadwick came up with an
ingenious solution. The masses of the nuclei of the various
chemical elements were already known, and techniques had
already been developed for measuring the speed of a rapidly
moving nucleus. He therefore set out to bombard samples of
selected elements with the mysterious new particles. When a
direct, head-on collision occurred between a mystery
particle and the nucleus of one of the target atoms, the
nucleus would be knocked out of the atom, and he would
measure its velocity.

Suppose, for instance, that we bombard a sample of hydrogen
atoms with the mystery particles. Since the participants in
the collision are fundamental particles, there is no way for
kinetic energy to be converted into heat or any other form
of energy, and Chadwick thus had two equations in three
unknowns:

equation \#1: conservation of momentum

equation \#2: no loss of kinetic energy

unknown \#1: mass of the mystery particle

unknown \#2: initial velocity of the mystery particle

unknown \#3:  final velocity of the mystery particle

The number of unknowns is greater than the number of
equations, so there is no unique solution. But by creating
collisions with nuclei of another element, nitrogen, he
gained two more equations at the expense of only one more
unknown:

equation \#3: conservation of momentum in the new collision

equation \#4: no loss of kinetic energy in the new collision

unknown \#4: final velocity of the mystery particle in the
new collision

\enlargethispage{\baselineskip}

He was thus able to solve for all the unknowns, including
the mass of the mystery particle, which was indeed within 1\%
of the mass of a proton. He named the new particle the
neutron, since it is electrically neutral.

a motion that appears complicated actually has a very simple feature. In both
cases, there is a particular point, called the center of mass\index{center of mass},
whose motion is surprisingly simple. The highjumper flexes his body as he passes
over the bar, so his motion is intrinsically very complicated, and yet his center of
mass's motion is a simple parabola, just like the parabolic arc of a pointlike
particle. The wrench's center of mass travels in a straight line as seen from above,

        The highjumper and the wrench are both complicated systems,
        each consisting of
        zillions of subatomic particles. To understand what's going on, let's instead look at a nice
        simple system, two pool balls colliding.
        We assume the balls are a closed system (i.e., their interaction with the felt
        surface is not important) and that their rotation is unimportant, so that
        we'll be able to treat each one as a single particle.
        By symmetry, the only place their center of mass can be is half-way in between,
        at an $x$ coordinate equal to the average of the two balls' positions,
        $x_{cm}=(x_1+x_2)/2$.

Figure \figref{cmballs} makes it appear that the center
of mass, marked with an $\times$, moves with constant velocity to the right,
regardless of the collision, and we can easily prove this using conservation
of momentum:
\begin{align*}
        v_{cm}         &= \der{}x_{cm}/\der{}t \\
                        &= \frac{1}{2}(v_1+v_2) \\
                        & = \frac{1}{2m}(mv_1+mv_2) \\
                        & = \frac{p_{total}}{m_{total}}
\end{align*}
Since momentum is conserved, the last expression is constant,        which proves that $v_{cm}$ is constant.

Rearranging this a little, we have $p_{total}=m_{total}v_{cm}$.
In other words, the total momentum of the system is the same
as if all its mass was concentrated at the center of mass
point.

\index{sigma notation}
        When there is a large, potentially unknown number of particles,
        we can write sums like the ones occurring above using symbols like ``$+\ldots$,''
        but that gets awkward. It's more convenient to use the Greek
        uppercase sigma, $\Sigma$, to indicate addition. For example,
        the sum $1^2+2^2+3^2+4^2=30$ could be written as
        \begin{equation*}
                \sum_{j=1}^n{j^2} = 30\eqquad,
        \end{equation*}
        read ``the sum from $j=1$ to $n$ of $j^2$.'' The variable $j$ is
        a dummy variable, just like the $\der{}x$ in an integral that tells you you're
        integrating with respect to $x$, but has no significance outside the integral.
        The $j$ below the sigma
        tells you what variable is changing from one term of the sum to the
        next, but $j$ has no significance outside the sum.  

As an example,
let's generalize the proof of $p_{total}=m_{total}v_{cm}$ to
the case of an arbitrary number $n$ of identical particles moving in one
dimension, rather than just two particles. The center of mass is at
\begin{align*}
        x_{cm}        &= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}{x_j}\eqquad,
\end{align*}
where $x_1$ is the mass of the first particle, and so on. The velocity of the center of mass is
\begin{align*}
        v_{cm}         &= \der{}x_{cm}/\der{}t \\
                        &= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}{v_j} \\
                        &= \frac{1}{nm}\sum_{j=1}^{n}{mv_j} \\
                        & = \frac{p_{total}}{m_{total}}
\end{align*}

What about a system containing objects with unequal masses,
or containing more than two objects? The reasoning above can
be generalized to a weighted average:
\begin{align*}
        x_{cm}        &= \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n}{m_jx_j}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}{m_j}}

        doesn't really stay in one place while the planets orbit around it.
        Actually, motion is relative, so it's meaningless to ask whether the

        moves in a straight line at constant velocity.
        We can now see that since the solar system is a closed system,
        its total momentum must be constant, and
        $p_{total}= m_{total}v_{cm}$ then tells us
        that it's the solar system's center of mass that has constant velocity,

\eganswer The center of mass is a sort of average, so the height
of the centers of mass in 1 and 2 has to be midway between the
two squares, because that height is the average of the heights
of the two squares. Example 3 is a combination of examples 1
and 2, so we can find its center of mass by averaging the horizontal
positions of their centers of mass. In example 4, each 
square has been skewed a little, but just as much mass has been
moved up as down, so the average vertical position of the mass
hasn't changed. Example 5 is clearly not all that different from
example 4, the main difference being a slight clockwise rotation,
so just as in example 4, the center of mass must be hanging in
empty space, where there isn't actually any mass. Horizontally,
the center of mass must be between the heels and toes, or else
it wouldn't be possible to stand without tipping over.

\begin{eg}{Momentum and Galilean relativity}
The principle of Galilean relativity states that the
laws of physics are supposed to be equally valid in all
inertial frames of reference. If we first calculate some
momenta in one frame of reference and find that momentum is
conserved, and then rework the whole problem in some other
frame of reference that is moving with respect to the first,
the numerical values of the momenta will all be different.
Even so, momentum will still be conserved. All that matters
is that we work a single problem in one consistent frame of
reference.

One way of proving this is to apply the equation
$p_{total}=m_{total}v_{cm}$. If the velocity of one frame relative to
the other is $u$, then the only effect of changing frames of
reference is to change $v_{cm}$ from its original value to
$v_{cm}+u$. This adds a constant onto the momentum,
which has no effect on conservation of momentum.

        understanding of collisions.

\begin{eg}{A collision of pool balls viewed in the c.m. frame}\label{eg:cmballs2}
If you move your head so that your eye is always above the
point halfway in between the two pool balls, as in figure \figref{cmballs2}, you are viewing
things in the center of mass frame. In this frame, the balls
come toward the center of mass at equal speeds. By symmetry,
they must therefore recoil at equal speeds along the lines
on which they entered. Since the balls have essentially
swapped paths in the center of mass frame, the same must
also be true in any other frame. This is the same result
that required laborious algebra to prove previously without
the concept of the center of mass frame.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{The slingshot effect}\label{eg:slingshot}
It is a counterintuitive fact that a spacecraft can pick up
speed by swinging around a planet, if it arrives in the
opposite direction compared to the planet's motion. Although
there is no physical contact, we treat the encounter as a
one-dimensional collision, and analyze it in the center of
mass frame. Since Jupiter is so much more massive than the
spacecraft, the center of mass is essentially fixed at
Jupiter's center, and Jupiter has zero velocity in the
center of mass frame, as shown in figure \ref{eg:slingshot2}. The c.m. frame
is moving to the left compared to the sun-fixed frame used
in figure \ref{eg:slingshot1}, so the spacecraft's initial velocity is greater in
this frame than in the sun's frame.

Things are simpler in the center of mass frame, because it
is more symmetric. In the sun-fixed frame, the incoming leg
of the encounter is rapid, because the two bodies are
rushing toward each other, while their separation on the
outbound leg is more gradual, because Jupiter is trying to
catch up. In the c.m. frame, Jupiter is sitting still, and
there is perfect symmetry between the incoming and outgoing
legs, so by symmetry we have $v_{1f}=- v_{1i}$. Going back to the
sun-fixed frame, the spacecraft's final velocity is
increased by the frames' motion relative to each other. In
the sun-fixed frame, the spacecraft's velocity has increased
greatly.

We've assumed we were dealing with a system of material objects,
for which the equation $ p=mv$ was true. What if our system contains only light
rays, or a mixture of light and matter? 
 As a college
student, Einstein kept worrying about was what a beam of light
would look like if you could ride alongside it on a motorcycle. In other
words, he imagined putting himself in the light beam's center of mass frame.
Chapter \ref{ch:rel} discusses Einstein's resolution of this problem, but the basic point is
that you \emph{can't} ride the motorcycle alongside the light beam, because material
objects can't go as fast as the speed of light. A beam of light has no center of
mass frame of reference.

<% begin_sec("Totally inelastic collisions",0,'totally-inelastic') %>

On p.~\pageref{elastic-and-inelastic} we discussed collisions that were totally elastic (no
conversion of KE into other types of energy). A useful application of the
center of mass frame of reference is to the description of the opposite extreme,
a totally \emph{inelastic} collision.

A totally inelastic collision cannot just be defined
as one in which all the KE is converted into other forms, both because the definition
would depend on our frame of reference and because
there is a constraint imposed by conservation of momentum. Let's say that
a golfer hits a ball. In the frame of reference of the grass,
it would violate conservation of momentum if
the ball were to stay put while the club simply stopped moving. If such a complete
cessation of motion is to happen, then it must occur in the center of mass frame
of reference. In the c.m.~frame, there is zero total momentum both before and after
the collision. Thus if we observe no motion at all after the collision, we must be in the
c.m.~frame. 

Therefore we define a totally inelastic collision as one in which there is no
motion in the c.m.~frame in the final state.\index{collision!totally inelastic}
An observer watching such a collision, in any frame, will see that
the amount of KE transformed into other forms of energy is
as great as possible subject to conservation of momentum.

When objects touch physically (possibly crumpling or changing shape during
the collision) in a totally elastic collision, the final state in the c.m.~frame
is one in which the two objects are at rest and touching. In other frames of reference,
we see the objects stick to each other and travel away together after the collision.
An example of this type was example \ref{eg:rear-ended}
on p.~\pageref{eg:rear-ended}, in which one car rear-ended another, and they stuck
together as a unit after the crash.

For every conserved quantity, we can define an associated rate of flow.
An open system can have mass transferred in or out of it, and we can measure the
rate of mass flow, $\der{}m/\der{}t$ in units of kg/s. Energy can flow in or out, and
the rate of energy transfer is the power, $P=\der{}E/\der{}t$, measured in
watts.\footnote{Recall that uppercase $P$ is power, while lowercase $p$ is momentum.}
 The rate of
\emph{momentum} transfer is called force,\index{force!defined}
\begin{equation*}
        F = \frac{\der{}p}{\der{}t} \qquad \text{[definition of force]}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
The units of force are $\kgunit\unitdot\munit/\sunit^2$, which can be abbreviated
as newtons, $1\ \nunit=\kgunit\unitdot\munit/\sunit^2$.\index{newton (unit)}
Newtons are unfortunately not as familiar as watts. A newton
is about how much force you'd use to pet a dog. The most powerful rocket engine
ever built, the first stage of the Saturn V that sent
astronauts to the moon, had a thrust of about 30 million newtons.
In one dimension, positive and negative signs indicate the direction of the force ---
a positive force is one that pushes or pulls in the direction
of the positive $x$ axis.

\begin{eg}{Walking into a lamppost}
\egquestion
Starting from rest, you begin walking, bringing
your momentum up to 100 $\momunit$. You walk straight into a
lamppost. Why is the momentum change of $-100\ \momunit$ so much
more painful than the change of $+100\ \momunit$ when you started
walking?

\eganswer
The forces are not really constant, but for this type of qualitative
discussion we can pretend they are, and approximate $\der{} p/\der{} t$
as $\Delta{} p/\Delta{} t$.
It probably takes you
about 1 s to speed up initially, so the ground's force on
you is $F=\Delta{} p/\Delta{} t\approx100\ \zu{N}$.
Your impact with the lamppost,
however, is over in the blink of an eye, say 1/10 s or less.
Dividing by this much smaller $\Delta{} t$ gives a much larger force,
perhaps thousands of newtons (with a negative sign).
\end{eg}

This is also the principle of airbags in cars. The time
required for the airbag to decelerate your head is fairly
long: the time it takes your face to travel 20 or 30 cm.
Without an airbag, your face would have hit the

shorter time taken by your skull to move a couple of
centimeters while your face compressed. Note that either
way, the same amount of momentum is transferred:
the entire momentum of your head.

Force is defined as a derivative, and the derivative of a sum is the sum
of the derivatives. Therefore force is additive: when more than one force
acts on an object, you add the forces to find out what happens. An important special case
is that forces can cancel. Consider your body sitting in a chair as you read
this book. Let the positive $x$ axis be upward. The chair's upward force
on you is represented with a positive number, which cancels out with
the earth's downward gravitational force, which is negative. The total rate
of momentum transfer into your body is zero, and your body doesn't
change its momentum.

\begin{eg}{Finding momentum from force}
\egquestion An object of mass $m$ starts at rest at $t=t_\zu{o}$. 
A force varying as $F=bt^{-2}$,
where $b$ is a constant, begins acting on it. Find the greatest speed it will
ever have.

\eganswer
\begin{align*}
F &= \frac{\der p}{\der t} \\
\der p &= F \der t \\
p &= \int F \der t + p_\zu{o}\\
  &= -\frac{b}{t}+p_\zu{o}\eqquad,
\end{align*}
where $p_\zu{o}$ is a constant of integration.
The given initial condition is that $p=0$ at $t=t_\zu{o}$, so we find that $p_\zu{o}=b/t_\zu{o}$. The negative term gets closer
to zero with increasing time, so the maximum momentum is achieved by letting $t$ approach infinity. That is, the
object will never stop speeding up, but it will also never surpass a certain speed. In the limit $t\rightarrow\infty$,
we identify $p_\zu{o}$ as the momentum that the object will approach asymptotically. The maximum
velocity is $v=p_\zu{o}/m=b/mt_\zu{o}$.

<% begin_sec("Newton's laws") %>

Although momentum is the third conserved quantity we've encountered,
historically it was the first to be discovered. Isaac Newton formulated a
complete treatment of mechanical systems in terms of force and momentum.
Newton's theory was based on three laws of motion, which we now
think of as consequences of conservation of mass, energy, and momentum.

\begin{tabular}{|p{90mm}|}
\hline
Newton's laws in one dimension:\\
\hline
\hline
\noindent\textsl{Newton's first law:\/} If there is no force acting on
an object, it stays in the same state of motion.\\
\hline
\noindent\textsl{Newton's second law:\/} The sum of all the forces acting on an
object determines the rate at which its momentum changes, $F_{total}=\der{}p/\der{}t$.\\

If object A interacts with object B, then A's force on B and B's force on
A are related by $F_{AB}=-F_{BA}$.\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\noindent{}The second law is the definition of force, which we've already
encountered.\footnote{This is with the benefit of hindsight. At the time,
the word ``force'' already had certain connotations, and people thought
they understood what it meant and how to measure it, e.g., by using a spring
scale. From their point of view, $F=\der{}p/\der{}t$ was not a definition but a
testable --- and controversial! --- statement.} The first law is a special case 
of the second
law ---
if $\der{}p/\der{}t$ is
zero, then $p=mv$ is a constant, and since mass is conserved, constant $p$
implies constant $v$.
 The third law is a restatement of conservation of momentum: for two objects
interacting, we have constant total momentum, so $0=\frac{\der}{\der{}t}(p_A+p_B)
=F_{BA}+F_{AB}$.

\begin{eg}{a=F/m}
Many modern textbooks restate Newton's second law as $a= F/ m$, i.e.,
as an equation that predicts an object's acceleration based on the force exerted on it.
This is easily derived from Newton's original form as follows:
$a=\zu{d} v/\zu{d} t=(\zu{d} p/\zu{d} t)/ m= F/ m$.
\end{eg}
\begin{eg}{Gravitational force related to g}
As a special case of the previous example, consider an object in free fall, and
let the $x$ axis point down. Then $a=+g$, and
$F= ma= mg$. For example, the gravitational force on a 1 kg mass
at the earth's surface is about 9.8 N. Even if other forces act on the object, and it
isn't in free fall, the gravitational force on it is still the same, and can still be
calculated as $mg$.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Changing frames of reference}
Suppose we change from one frame reference into another, which is moving relative
to the first one at a constant velocity $u$. If an object of mass $m$ is moving
at velocity $v$ (which need not be constant), then the effect is to change its
momentum from $mv$ in one frame to $mv+mu$ in the other. Force is defined
as the derivative of momentum with respect to time, and the derivative of a constant
is zero, so adding the constant $mu$ has no effect on the result. We therefore conclude
that observers in different inertial frames of reference agree on forces.
\end{eg}

<% begin_sec("Using the third law correctly") %>

If you've already accepted Galilean relativity in your heart, then there is nothing
really difficult about the first and second laws. The third law, however, is more
of a conceptual challenge. The first hurdle is that it is counterintuitive. Is it really
true that if a fighter jet collides with a mosquito,
the mosquito's force on the jet is just as strong as the jet's force on the mosquito?
Yes, it is true, but it is hard to believe at first. That amount of force simply has more of an effect
on the mosquito, because it has less mass.

        A more humane
        and practical experiment is shown in figure \figref{third-law-magnets}.
        A large magnet and a small magnet
        are weighed separately, and then one magnet is hung from the
        pan of the top balance so that it is directly above the
        other magnet. There is an attraction between the two
        magnets, causing the reading on the top scale to increase
        and the reading on the bottom scale to decrease. The large
        magnet is more ``powerful'' in the sense that it can pick up a
        heavier paperclip from the same distance, so many people
        have a strong expectation that one scale's reading will
        change by a far different amount than the other. Instead, we
        find that the two changes are equal in magnitude but
        opposite in direction, so the upward force of the top magnet
        on the bottom magnet is of the same magnitude as the
        downward force of the bottom magnet on the top magnet.

\enlargethispage{-\baselineskip}

To students, it often sounds as though Newton's third law
implies nothing could ever change its motion, since the two
equal and opposite forces would always cancel. 
As illustrated in figure \figref{bartab}, the fallacy arises
from assuming that we can add things that it doesn't make sense to add.
It only makes sense to
add up forces that are acting on the same object, whereas
two forces related to each other by Newton's third law are
always acting on two different objects.
 If two objects are interacting via a force and no other forces are
involved, then \emph{both\/} objects will accelerate --- in opposite
directions, as shown in figure \figref{skaters}!    

Here are some suggestions for avoiding misapplication of Newton's third law:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It always relates exactly two forces, not more.
\item The two forces involve exactly two objects, in the pattern A on B, B on A.
\item The two forces are always of the same type, e.g., friction and friction, or gravity and gravity.
\end{enumerate}

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("Directions of forces") %>

We've already seen that momentum, unlike energy, has a direction in space. Since force is defined in terms
of momentum, force also has a direction in space. For motion in one dimension, we have to pick a coordinate
system, and given that choice, forces and momenta will be positive or negative. We've already used signs
to represent directions of forces in Newton's third law, $F_{AB}=-F_{BA}$.

\enlargethispage{-\baselineskip}

There is, however, a complication with force that we were able to avoid with momentum. If an object is moving
on a line, we're guaranteed that its momentum is in one of two directions: the two directions along the
line. But even an object that stays on a line may still be subject to forces that act perpendicularly to the
line. For example, suppose a coin is sliding to the right across a table, \figref{unavoidable-crosswise-forces}, and let's choose a positive
$x$ axis that points to the right. The coin's motion is along a horizontal line, and its momentum is
positive and decreasing. Because the momentum is decreasing, its time derivative $\der p/\der t$ is negative. This
derivative equals the horizontal force of friction $F_1$, and its negative sign tells us that this force on the coin is to the left.

%>
<% end_marg %>

But there are also vertical forces on the coin. The Earth exerts a downward gravitational force $F_2$ on it, and
the table makes an upward force $F_3$ that prevents the coin from sinking into the wood. In fact, without these vertical
forces the horizontal frictional force wouldn't exist: surfaces don't exert friction against one another unless
they are being pressed together.

To avoid mathematical complication, we want to postpone the full three-dimensional treatment of force and
momentum until section \ref{sec:motion-in-three-d}. For now, we'll limit ourselves to examples like the coin,
in which the motion is confined to a line, and any forces perpendicular to the line cancel each other out.

Conservation laws are more fundamental than Newton's laws,
and they apply where Newton's laws don't, e.g., to light and to
the internal structure of atoms. However, there are certain problems
that are much easier to solve using Newton's laws. As a trivial example,
if you drop a rock, it could conserve momentum and energy by levitating,
or by falling in the usual manner.\footnote{This pathological solution was

on page \pageref{hovering}.} With Newton's laws, however, we can
reason that $a=F/m$, so the rock must respond to the gravitational force
by accelerating.

Less trivially, suppose a person is hanging onto a rope, and we want to
know if she will slip. Unlike the case of the levitating rock, here the
no-motion solution could be perfectly reasonable if her grip is strong
enough. We know that her hand's interaction with the rope is fundamentally
an electrical interaction between the atoms in the surface of her palm and
the nearby atoms in the surface of the rope. For practical problem-solving,
however, this is a case where we're better off forgetting the fundamental
classification of interactions at the atomic level and working with a more
practical, everyday classification of forces. In this practical scheme, we
have three types of forces that can occur between solid objects in contact:

If you put a coin on this page, which is horizontal, gravity pulls down on the coin,
but the atoms in the paper and the coin repel each other electrically, and the atoms
are compressed until the repulsion becomes strong enough to stop the downward
motion of the coin. We describe this complicated and invisible atomic process by
saying that the paper makes an upward normal force on the coin, and the coin
makes a downward normal force on the paper. (The two normal forces are related by
Newton's third law. In fact, Newton's third law only relates forces that are of the same
type.)

If you now tilt the book a little, static friction keeps the coin from slipping. The
picture at the microscopic level is even more complicated than the previous
description of the normal force. One model is to think of the tiny bumps and
depressions in the coin as settling into the similar irregularities in the paper.
This model predicts that rougher surfaces should have more friction, which is
sometimes true but not always. Two very smooth, clean glass surfaces or very well
finished machined metal surfaces may actually stick \emph{better} than
rougher surfaces would, the probable explanation being that there is some kind of
chemical bonding going on, and the smoother surfaces allow more atoms to be
in contact.

Finally, as you tilt the book more and more, there comes a point where static
friction reaches its maximum value. The surfaces become unstuck, and the
coin begins to slide over the paper. Kinetic friction slows down this slipping motion
significantly. In terms of energy, kinetic friction is converting mechanical energy
into heat, just like when you rub your hands together to keep warm. One model
of kinetic friction is that the tiny irregularities in the two surfaces bump against
each other, causing vibrations whose energy rapidly converts to heat and sound ---
you can hear this sound if you rub your fingers together near your ear.

\egquestion
Rubber on asphalt gives $\mu_k\approx0.4$ and $\mu_s\approx 0.6$.
What is the upper limit on a car's acceleration on a flat road, assuming that the engine
has plenty of power and that air friction is negligible?

\eganswer
This isn't a flying car, so we don't expect it to accelerate vertically. The vertical forces acting on the car should cancel out.
The earth makes a downward gravitational force on the car whose absolute value is $mg$, so the road apparently makes an upward normal force
of the same magnitude, $F_n= mg$.

Now what about the horizontal motion? As is always true, the coefficient
of static friction is greater than the coefficient of kinetic friction, so the maximum acceleration
is obtained with static friction, i.e., the driver should try not to burn rubber.
The maximum force of static friction is $F_{s,max}=\mu_{s} F_{n} =\mu_s mg$. The maximum acceleration is 
$a= F_s/ m=\mu_{s} g\approx6\ \munit/\sunit^2$. This
is true regardless of how big the tires are, since the experimentally determined
relationship $F_{s,max}=\mu_{s} F_n$ is independent of
surface area.

\begin{eg}{Locomotives}\label{eg:locomotives}
Looking at a picture of a locomotive, \figref{locomotive}, we notice
two obvious things that are different from an automobile. Where a car
typically has two drive wheels, a locomotive normally has many --- ten
in this example. (Some also have smaller, unpowered wheels in front of and
behind the drive wheels, but this example doesn't.) Also, cars these days are generally built to be as light as possible
for their size, whereas locomotives are very massive, and no effort seems to be made
to keep their weight low. (The steam locomotive in the photo is from about 1900, but this
is true even for modern diesel and electric trains.)

<% fig('locomotive','Example \ref{eg:locomotives}.',
    {
      'width'=>'wide',
      'sidecaption'=>true
    }
) %>

The reason locomotives are built to be so heavy is for traction. The upward normal force of
the rails on the wheels, $F_N$, cancels the downward force of gravity, $F_W$, so ignoring plus and minus
signs, these two forces are equal in absolute value, $F_N=F_W$. Given this amount of normal
force, the maximum force of static friction is $F_s=\mu_s F_N=\mu_s F_W$. This static frictional
force, of the rails pushing forward on the wheels, is the only force that can accelerate the
train, pull it uphill, or cancel out the force of air resistance while cruising at constant speed.
The coefficient of static friction for steel on steel is about 1/4, so no locomotive can pull
with a force greater than about 1/4 of its own weight. If the engine is capable of supplying
more than that amount of force, the result will be simply to break static friction and spin the wheels.

The reason this is all so different from the situation with a car is that a car isn't pulling
something else. If you put extra weight in a car, you improve the traction, but you also
increase the inertia of the car, and make it just as hard to accelerate. In a train, the inertia
is almost all in the cars being pulled, not in the locomotive.

The other fact we have to explain is the large number of driving wheels. First, we have to
realize that increasing the number of driving wheels neither increases nor decreases the
total amount of static friction, because static friction is independent of the amount of
surface area in contact. (The reason four-wheel-drive is good in a car is that if one or
more of the wheels is slipping on ice or in mud, the other wheels may still have traction.
This isn't typically an issue for a train, since all the wheels experience the same conditions.)
The advantage of having more driving wheels on a train is that it allows us to increase the weight of the locomotive
without crushing the rails, or damaging bridges.

Try to drive a nail into a waterfall and you will be
confronted with the main difference between solid friction
and fluid friction. Fluid friction is purely kinetic; there
is no static fluid friction. The nail in the waterfall may
tend to get dragged along by the water flowing past it, but
it does not stick in the water. The same is true for gases
such as air: recall that we are using the word ``fluid'' to
include both gases and liquids.

Unlike kinetic friction between solids, fluid friction
increases rapidly with velocity. It also depends
on the shape of the object, which is why a fighter jet is
more streamlined than a Model T.
For objects of the same shape but different sizes, fluid friction
typically scales up with the cross-sectional area of the
object, which is one of the main reasons that an SUV gets
worse mileage on the freeway than a compact car.

Newton's first and second laws deal with the total of all
the forces exerted on a specific object, so it is very
important to be able to figure out what forces there are.
Once you have focused your attention on one object and
listed the forces on it, it is also helpful to describe all
the corresponding forces that must exist according to
Newton's third law. We refer to this as ``analyzing the
forces'' in which the object participates.

\begin{egwide}{A barge}
A barge is being pulled along a canal by teams of horses on
the shores. Analyze all the forces in which the barge participates.

\vspace{2mm}

\begin{tabular}{|p{70mm}|p{70mm}|}
\hline
\emph{force acting on barge}  &   \emph{force related to it by Newton's third law} \\
\hline
ropes' forward normal forces on barge  &  barge's backward normal force on ropes\\
\hline
water's backward fluid friction force on barge  &  barge's forward fluid friction force on water\\
\hline
planet earth's downward gravitational force on barge  &  barge's upward gravitational force on earth\\
\hline
water's upward ``floating'' force on barge  &  barge's downward ``floating'' force on water\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\vspace{2mm}

Here I've used the word ``floating'' force as an example of
a sensible invented term for a type of force not classified
on the tree in the previous section. A more formal technical
term would be ``hydrostatic force.''

Note how the pairs of forces are all structured as ``A's
force on B, B's force on A'': ropes on barge and barge on
ropes; water on barge and barge on water. Because all the
forces in the left column are forces acting on the barge,
all the forces in the right column are forces being exerted
by the barge, which is why each entry in the column
begins with ``barge.''
\end{egwide}

Often you may be unsure whether you have missed one of
the forces. Here are three strategies for checking your list:

\begin{indentedblock}
\noindent 1. See what physical result would come from the forces
you've found so far. Suppose, for instance, that you'd
forgotten the ``floating'' force on the barge in the example
above. Looking at the forces you'd found, you would have
found that there was a downward gravitational force on the
barge which was not canceled by any upward force. The barge
isn't supposed to sink, so you know you need to find a
fourth, upward force.

\noindent 2. Whenever one solid object touches another, there will
be a normal force, and possibly also a frictional force; check for
both.

\noindent 3. Make a drawing of the object, and draw a dashed boundary
line around it that separates it from its environment. Look
for points on the boundary where other objects come in
contact with your object. This strategy guarantees that
you'll find every contact force that acts on the object,
although it won't help you to find non-contact forces.

\end{indentedblock}

The following is another example in which we can profit by
checking against our physical intuition for what should be happening.

\begin{egwide}{Rappelling}
As shown in the figure below, Cindy is rappelling down a
cliff. Her downward motion is at constant speed, and she
takes little hops off of the cliff, as shown by the dashed
line. Analyze the forces in which she participates at a
moment when her feet are on the cliff and she is pushing off.

\begin{tabular}{|p{70mm}|p{70mm}|}
\hline
\emph{force acting on Cindy}  &   \emph{force related to it by Newton's third law} \\
\hline
planet earth's downward gravitational force on Cindy  &  Cindy's upward gravitational force on earth\\
\hline
ropes upward frictional force on Cindy (her hand)  &  Cindy's downward frictional force on the rope\\
\hline
cliff's rightward normal force on Cindy  &  Cindy's leftward normal force on the cliff\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The two vertical forces cancel, which is what they should be
doing if she is to go down at a constant rate. The only
horizontal force on her is the cliff's force, which is not
canceled by any other force, and which therefore will
produce an acceleration of Cindy to the right. This makes
sense, since she is hopping off. (This solution is a little
oversimplified, because the rope is slanting, so it also
applies a small leftward force to Cindy. As she flies out to
the right, the slant of the rope will increase, pulling her
back in more strongly.)
\end{egwide}

I believe that constructing the type of table described in
this section is the best method for beginning students. Most
textbooks, however, prescribe a pictorial way of showing all
the forces acting on an object. Such a picture is called a
free-body diagram. It should not be a big problem if a
future physics professor expects you to be able to draw such
diagrams, because the conceptual reasoning is the same. You
simply draw a picture of the object, with arrows representing
the forces that are acting on it. Arrows representing
contact forces are drawn from the point of contact,
noncontact forces from the center of mass. Free-body
diagrams do not show the equal and opposite forces exerted
by the object itself.

You're walking your dog. The dog wants to go faster than you
do, and the leash is taut. Does Newton's third law guarantee
that your force on your end of the leash is equal and
opposite to the dog's force on its end? If they're not
exactly equal, is there any reason why they should be
approximately equal?

If there was no leash between you, and you were in direct
contact with the dog, then Newton's third law would apply,
but Newton's third law cannot relate your force on the leash
to the dog's force on the leash, because that would involve
three separate objects. Newton's third law only says that
your force on the leash is equal and opposite to the
leash's force on you,
\begin{equation*}
        F_{yL}  =  - F_{Ly}  ,
\end{equation*}

and that the dog's force on the leash is equal and opposite
to its force on the dog
\begin{equation*}
        F_{dL}  =  - F_{Ld}  .
\end{equation*}
Still, we have a strong intuitive expectation that whatever
force we make on our end of the leash is transmitted to the
dog, and vice-versa. We can analyze the situation by
concentrating on the forces that act on the leash, $F_{dL}$
and $F_{yL}$. According to Newton's second law, these relate
to the leash's mass and acceleration:
\begin{equation*}
        F_{dL} + F_{yL}  =  m_La_L  .
\end{equation*}
The leash is far less massive then any of the other objects
involved, and if $m_L$ is very small, then apparently the
total force on the leash is also very small, $F_{dL}$ +
$F_{yL}\approx 0$, and therefore
\begin{equation*}
 F_{dL}\approx - F_{yL}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Thus even though Newton's third law does not apply directly
to these two forces, we can approximate the low-mass leash
as if it was not intervening between you and the dog. It's
at least approximately as if you and the dog were acting
directly on each other, in which case Newton's third
law would have applied.

In general, low-mass objects can be treated approximately as
if they simply transmitted forces from one object to
another. This can be true for strings, ropes, and cords, and
also for rigid objects such as rods and sticks.

If you look at a piece of string under a magnifying glass as
you pull on the ends more and more strongly, you will see
the fibers straightening and becoming taut. Different parts
of the string are apparently exerting forces on each other.
For instance, if we think of the two halves of the string as
two objects, then each half is exerting a force on the other
half. If we imagine the string as consisting of many small
parts, then each segment is transmitting a force to the next
segment, and if the string has very little mass, then all
the forces are equal in magnitude. We refer to the magnitude
of the forces as the tension in the string, $T$.\index{tension}

The term ``tension'' refers only to internal forces within the string.
If the string makes
forces on objects at its ends, then those forces are typically
normal or frictional forces (example \ref{eg:types-of-forces-made-by-ropes}).

In all cases, a rope can only make ``pulling'' forces, i.e., forces that are parallel to its own length
and that are toward itself, not away from itself. You can't push with a rope!

In \subfigref{tension-is-not-a-type-of-force}{1}, the rope passes through a type of hook, called a
carabiner, used in rock climbing and mountaineering. Since the rope can only pull along its own length,
the direction of its force on the carabiner must be down and to the right. This is perpendicular to
the surface of contact, so the force is a normal force.

In figure \subfigref{tension-is-not-a-type-of-force}{2}, the rope can only exert a net force at its end that is
parallel to itself and in the pulling direction, so its force on the hand is down and to the left.
This is parallel
to the surface of contact, so it must be a frictional force. If the rope isn't slipping through the hand,
we have static friction. Friction can't exist without normal forces. These forces are perpendicular to the
surface of contact.
For simplicity, we show only two pairs of these normal forces, as if the hand were a pair of pliers.

If a rope goes over a pulley or around some other object,
then the tension throughout the rope is approximately equal
so long as the pulley has negligible mass and there is not too much friction. A rod or stick
can be treated in much the same way as a string, but it is
possible to have either compression or tension.

To change the kinetic energy, $K=(1/2)mv^2$, of a particle moving in one dimension, 
we must change its velocity. That will entail a change in its momentum, $p=mv$, as
well, and since force is the rate of transfer of momentum, we conclude that the only
way to change a particle's kinetic energy is to apply a force.\footnote{The converse
isn't true, because kinetic energy doesn't depend on the direction of motion, but
momentum does. We can change a particle's momentum without changing its
energy, as when a pool ball bounces off a bumper, reversing the sign of $p$.}
A force in the same direction as the motion speeds it up, increasing the kinetic
energy, while a force in the opposite direction slows it down.

Consider an infinitesimal time interval during which the particle moves
an infinitesimal distance $\der{}x$, and its kinetic energy changes by $\der{}K$.
In one dimension,
we represent the direction of the force and the direction of the motion with
positive and negative signs for $F$ and $\der{}x$, so the relationship among the
signs can be summarized as follows:
\begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
        \hline
        $F>0$        & $\der{}x>0$        & $\der{}K>0$ \\

        $F<0$        & $\der{}x<0$        & $\der{}K>0$ \\

In general, when energy is transferred by a force,\footnote{The part of the
definition about ``by a force'' is meant to exclude the transfer of energy
by heat conduction, as when a stove heats soup.} we use the term
\emph{work}\index{work!defined} to refer to the amount of energy transferred.
This is different from the way the word is used in ordinary speech. If you
stand for a long time holding a bag of cement, you get tired, and
everyone will agree that you've worked hard, but you haven't changed the
energy of the cement, so according to the definition of the physics term,
you haven't done any work on the bag. There has been an energy transformation
inside your body, of chemical energy into heat, but this just means that
one part of your body did positive work (lost energy) while another part
did a corresponding amount of negative work (gained energy).

I derived the expression $F\der{}x$ for one particular type of kinetic-energy
transfer, the work done in accelerating a particle,
and then defined work as a more general term. Is the equation
correct for other types of work as well? For example,
if a force lifts a mass $m$ against the resistance of gravity at constant velocity,
the increase in the mass's gravitational energy is $\der{}(mgy)=mg\der{}y=F\der{}y$,
so again the equation works, but this still doesn't prove that the equation is \emph{always}
correct as a way of calculating energy transfers.

Imagine a black box\footnote{``Black box'' is a traditional engineering term
for a device whose inner workings we don't care about.}, containing a gasoline-powered
engine, which is designed to reel in a steel cable, exerting a certain force $F$.
For simplicity, we imagine that this force is always constant, so we can talk about
$\Delta{}x$ rather than an infinitesimal $\der{}x$. If this black box is used to
accelerate a particle (or any mass without internal structure), and no other forces
act on the particle, then the original derivation applies, and the work done by the
box is $W=F\Delta{}x$. Since $F$ is constant, the box will run out of gas after
reeling in a certain amount of cable $\Delta{}x$. The chemical energy inside the box
has decreased by $-W$, while the mass being accelerated has gained $W$ worth
of kinetic energy.\footnote{For conceptual simplicity, we ignore the transfer of
heat energy to the outside world via the exhaust and radiator. In reality, the
sum of these energies plus the useful kinetic energy transferred would equal $W$.}

Now what if we use the black box to pull a plow? The energy increase in the outside
world is of a different type than before; it
takes the forms of (1) the gravitational energy of the dirt that has been lifted out to the
sides of the furrow, (2) frictional heating of the dirt and the plowshare,
and (3) the energy needed to break up the dirt clods (a form of
electrical energy involving the attractions among the atoms in the clod). The box,
however, only communicates with the outside world via the hole through which its
cable passes. The amount of chemical energy lost by the gasoline can therefore
only depend on $F$ and $\Delta{}x$, so it is the same $-W$ as when the
box was being used to accelerate a mass, and thus by conservation of energy, the
work done on the outside world is again $W$.

<% end_marg %>

This is starting to sound like a proof that the force-times-distance method
is always correct, but there was one subtle assumption involved, which was that
the force was exerted at one point (the end of the cable, in the black box example). 
Real life often isn't like that. For example, a cyclist exerts forces on both pedals
at once. Serious cyclists use toe-clips, and the conventional wisdom is that one
should use equal amounts of force on the upstroke and downstroke, to make full
use of both sets of muscles. This is  a two-dimensional example, since the
pedals go in circles. We're
 only discussing one-dimensional motion right now, so let's just
pretend that the upstroke and downstroke are both executed in straight lines.
Since the forces are in opposite directions, one is positive and one is negative.
The cyclist's \emph{total} force on the crank set is zero, but the work done isn't
zero. We have to add the work done by each stroke, $W=F_1\Delta{}x_1+F_2\Delta{}x_2$.
(I'm pretending that both forces are constant, so we don't have to do integrals.)
Both terms are positive; one is a positive number multiplied by a positive number,
while the other is a negative times a negative.

This might not seem like a big deal --- just remember not to use the total force ---
but there are many situations where the total force is all we can measure. The ultimate
example is heat conduction. Heat conduction is not supposed to be counted as a form
of work, since it occurs without a force. But at the atomic level, there are forces, and
work is done by one atom on another. When you hold a hot potato in your hand, the
transfer of heat energy through your skin takes place with a total force that's extremely
close to zero. At the atomic level, atoms in your skin are interacting electrically with
atoms in the potato, but the attractions and repulsions add up to zero total force.
It's just like the cyclist's feet acting on the pedals, but with zillions of forces involved
instead of two. There is no practical way to measure all the individual forces, and
therefore we can't calculate the total energy transferred.

To summarize, $\sum{F_j\der{}x_j}$ is a correct way of calculating work, where
$F_j$ is the individual force acting on particle $j$, which moves a distance
$\der{}x_j$. However, this is only useful if
you can identify all the individual forces and determine the distance moved at
each point of contact. For convenience, I'll refer to this as the
\emph{work theorem}\index{work theorem}. (It doesn't have a standard name.)

There is, however, something useful we can do with the total force. We can use it
to calculate the part of the work done on an object that consists of a change in the
kinetic energy it has due to the motion of its center of mass. The proof is essentially
the same as the proof on p.~\pageref{originalworkderiv}, except that now we don't
assume the force is acting on a single particle, so we have to
be a little more delicate. Let the object consist of $n$ particles. Its total kinetic
energy is $K=\sum_{j=1}^n{(1/2)m_jv_j^2}$, but this is what we've already
realized \emph{can't} be calculated using the total force. The kinetic energy it
has due to motion of its center of mass is
\begin{align*}
        K_{cm}        &= \frac{1}{2}m_{total}v_{cm}^2\eqquad.
\end{align*}
Figure \figref{kcm} shows some examples of the distinction between $K_{cm}$ and $K$.
Differentiating $K_{cm}$, we have
\begin{align*}
        \der{}K_{cm}        &= m_{total}v_{cm}\der{}v_{cm} \\
                        &= m_{total}v_{cm}
                                        \frac{\der{}v_{cm}}{\der{}t}\frac{\der{}t}{\der{}x_{cm}}\der{}x_{cm}
                                        \qquad \text{[chain rule]} \\
                        &= m_{total}\frac{\der{}v_{cm}}{\der{}t}\der{}x_{cm} 
                                        \qquad \text{[$\der{}t/\der{}x_{cm}=1/v_{cm}$]} \\
                        &= \frac{\der{}p_{total}}{\der{}t}\der{}x_{cm} 
                                        \qquad \text{[$p_{total}=m_{total}v_{cm}$]} \\
                        &= F_{total}\der{}x_{cm}  
\end{align*}
I'll call this the \emph{kinetic energy theorem}\index{kinetic energy theorem} ---
like the work theorem, it has no standard name.

\begin{eg}{An ice skater pushing off from a wall}
The kinetic energy theorem tells us how to calculate
the skater's kinetic energy if we know the amount of force
and the distance her center of mass travels while she is
pushing off.

The work theorem tells us that the wall does no work on
the skater, since the point of contact isn't moving.
This makes sense, because the wall does not  have
any source of energy.

\egquestion
Is it possible to absorb an impact without
recoiling? For instance, if a ping-pong ball hits
a brick wall, does the wall ``give'' at all?

\eganswer
There will always be a recoil. In the example
proposed, the wall will surely have some energy transferred
to it in the form of heat and vibration. The work theorem
tells us that we can only have an energy transfer if the distance
traveled by the point of contact is nonzero.
\end{eg}



\begin{eg}{Dragging a refrigerator at constant velocity}
The fridge's momentum is constant, so there is no net
momentum transfer, and the total force on it
must be zero: your force is canceling the
floor's kinetic frictional force. The kinetic energy
theorem is therefore true but useless. It tells us that
there is zero total force on the refrigerator, and that the
refrigerator's kinetic energy doesn't change.

The work theorem tells us that the work you do equals
your hand's force on the refrigerator multiplied by the
distance traveled. Since we know the floor has no source of
energy, the only way for the floor and refrigerator to gain
energy is from the work you do. We can thus calculate the
total heat dissipated by friction in the refrigerator and
the floor.

Note that there is no way to find how much of the heat is
dissipated in the floor and how much in the refrigerator.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Accelerating a cart}
If you push on a cart and accelerate it, there are two
forces acting on the cart: your hand's force, and the static
frictional force of the ground pushing on the wheels in the
opposite direction.

Applying the work theorem to your force tells us how to
calculate the work you do.

Applying the work theorem to the floor's force tells us
that the floor does no work on the cart. There is no motion
at the point of contact, because the atoms in the floor are
not moving. (The atoms in the surface of the wheel are also
momentarily at rest when they touch the floor.) This makes
sense, because the floor does not have any source of energy.

The kinetic energy theorem refers to the total force,
and because the floor's backward force cancels part of your
force, the total force is less than your force. This tells
us that only part of your work goes into the kinetic energy
associated with the forward motion of the cart's center of
mass. The rest goes into rotation of the wheels.

Conservation of energy provided the necessary tools for analyzing some
mechanical systems, such as the seesaw on page \pageref{eg:seesaw} and the
pulley arrangements of the homework problems on page \pageref{hw:atwood-energy-sn}, but we could
only analyze those machines by computing the total energy of the system.
That approach wouldn't work for systems like the biceps/forearm
machine on page \pageref{fig:biceps}, or the one in figure \figref{pulley1},
where the energy content of the person's body is impossible to compute
directly. Even though the seesaw and the biceps/forearm system were clearly
just two different forms of the lever, we had no way to treat them both on the
same footing.
We can now successfully attack such problems using the work and
kinetic energy theorems.

\begin{eg}{Constant tension around a pulley}
\egquestion
In figure \figref{pulley1}, what is the relationship between the
force applied by the person's hand and the force exerted on the block?

\eganswer
If we assume the rope and the pulley are ideal, i.e., frictionless and
massless, then there is no way for them to absorb or release energy,
so the work done by the hand must be the same as the work done
on the block. Since the hand and the block move the same distance,
the work theorem tells us the two forces are the same.

Similar arguments provide an alternative justification for the statement
made in section \ref{subsec:transmitforces} that
show that an idealized rope
exerts the same force, the tension,\index{tension} anywhere it's attached to something, and the same
amount of force is also exerted by each segment of the rope on the neighboring
segments. Going around an ideal pulley also has no effect on the tension.

This is an example of a simple machine,\index{simple machine}
 which is any mechanical system
that manipulates forces to do work. This particular machine reverses the
direction of the motion, but doesn't change the force or the speed of motion.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{A mechanical advantage}
The idealized pulley in figure \figref{pulley2} has negligible
mass, so its kinetic energy is zero, and the kinetic energy theorem
tells us that the total force on it is zero. We know, as in the preceding
example, that the two forces
pulling it to the right are equal to each other, so the force on the left
must be twice as strong. This simple machine doubles the applied force,
and we refer to this ratio as a \emph{mechanical advantage} (M.A.) of 2.
There's no such thing as a free lunch, however; the distance traveled by
the load is cut in half, and there is no increase in the amount of work done.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Inclined plane and wedge}\label{eg:inclinedplanework}
In figure \figref{pulley3}, the force applied by the hand is equal
to the one applied to the load, but there is a mechanical advantage compared
to the force that would have been required to lift the load straight up.
The distance traveled up the inclined plane is greater by a factor of 1/sin $\theta$,
so by the work theorem, the force is smaller by a factor of sin $\theta$,
and we have M.A.=1/sin $\theta$. The wedge, \figref{wedge}, is similar.
\end{eg}

In one revolution, the crank travels a distance $2\pi{} b$, and the water

<% begin_sec("Force related to interaction energy") %>

In section \ref{gravphenomenasection}, we saw that there were two equivalent
ways of looking at gravity, the gravitational field and the gravitational energy.
They were related by the equation $\der{}U=mg\der{}r$, so if we knew the
field, we could find the energy by integration, $U=\int{mg\der{}r}$, and if we
knew the energy, we could find the field by differentiation, $g=(1/m)\der{}U/\der{}r$.

The same approach can be applied to other interactions, for example
a mass on a spring. The main difference is that only in gravitational interactions
does the strength of the interaction depend on the mass of the object, so
in general, it doesn't make sense to separate out the factor of $m$ as in the
equation $\der{}U=mg\der{}r$. Since $F=mg$ is the gravitational force,
we can rewrite the equation in the more suggestive
form $\der{}U=F\der{}r$. This form no longer refers to gravity specifically, and
can be applied much more generally. The only remaining detail is that I've been
fairly cavalier about positive and negative signs up until now. That wasn't such
a big problem for gravitational interactions, since gravity is always attractive, but
it requires more careful treatment for nongravitational forces, where we don't
necessarily know the direction of the force in advance, and we need to use
positive and negative signs carefully for the direction of the force.

In general, suppose that forces are acting on a particle --- we can think of them
as coming from other objects that are ``off stage'' --- and that the interaction between
the particle and the off-stage objects can be characterized by an
interaction energy, $U$, which depends only on the particle's position, $x$.
Using the kinetic energy theorem, we have $\der{}K=F\der{}x$. (It's not necessary
to write $K_{cm}$, since a particle can't have any other kind of kinetic energy.)
Conservation of energy tells us $\der{}K+\der{}U=0$, so the relationship between
force and interaction energy is $\der{}U=-F\der{}x$, or
\begin{equation*}
        F = -\frac{\der{}U}{\der{}x} 
                \qquad \text{[relationship between force and interaction energy]}\eqquad.

\begin{eg}{Force exerted by a spring}\label{eg:springforce}
        \egquestion
        A mass is attached to the end of a spring, and the energy of the spring
        is $U=(1/2) kx^2$, where $x$ is the position of the mass,
        and $x=0$ is defined to be the equilibrium position. What is the force
        the spring exerts on the mass? Interpret the sign of the result.

        \eganswer
        Differentiating, we find
        \begin{align*}
                 F        &= -\frac{\der{} U}{\der{} x} \\
                                &= - kx\eqquad.
        \end{align*}
        If $x$ is positive, then the force is negative, i.e., it acts so as to bring the
        mass back to equilibrium, and similarly for $x<0$ we have $F>0$.

        Most books do the $F=- kx$ form before the $U=(1/2) kx^2$
        form, and call it Hooke's law.\index{Hooke's law} Neither form is really more
        fundamental than the other --- we can always get from one to the other by integrating
        or differentiating.

\begin{eg}{Newton's law of gravity}
        \egquestion
        Given the equation $U=- Gm_1 m_{2}/ r$ for the energy
        of gravitational interactions, find the corresponding equation for the gravitational force
        on mass $m_2$. Interpret the positive and negative signs.

        \eganswer
        We have to be a little careful here, because we've been taking $r$ to be
        positive by definition, whereas the position, $x$, of mass $m_2$
        could be positive or negative, depending on which side of
        $m_1$ it's on.

        For positive $x$, we have $r= x$, and differentiation gives
        \begin{align*}
                 F        &= -\frac{\der{} U}{\der{} x} \\
                                &= - Gm_1 m_{2}/ x^2\eqquad.
        \end{align*}
        As in the preceding example, we have $F<0$ when $x$
        is positive, because the object is being attracted back toward $x=0$.

        When $x$ is negative, the relationship between $r$ and $x$ becomes
        $r=- x$, and the result for the force is the same as before, but with
        a minus sign. We can combine the two equations by writing
        \begin{equation*}
                | F|        =  Gm_1 m_{2}/ r^2\eqquad,
        \end{equation*}
        and this is the form traditionally known as Newton's law of gravity.
        As in the preceding example, the $U$ and $F$ equations contain
        equivalent information, and neither is more fundamental than the other.

Resonance is a phenomenon in which an oscillator responds most strongly\label{swing-resonance}
to a driving force that matches its own natural frequency of vibration.
For example, suppose a child is on a playground swing with a natural
frequency of 1 Hz. That is, if you pull the child away from equilibrium, release
her, and then stop doing anything for a while, she'll oscillate at 1 Hz.
If there was no friction, as we assumed in section \ref{sec:oscillations},
then the sum of her gravitational and kinetic energy would remain constant,
and the amplitude would be exactly the same from one oscillation to the next.
However, friction is going to convert these forms of energy into heat, so her
oscillations would gradually die out. To keep this from happening, you might
give her a push once per cycle, i.e., the frequency of your pushes would be
1 Hz, which is the same as the swing's natural frequency. As long as you stay
in rhythm, the swing responds quite well. If you start the swing from rest,
and then give pushes at 1 Hz, the swing's amplitude
rapidly builds up, as in figure \figref{swingimpulseatres}, until after a while it reaches a steady state
in which friction removes just as much energy as you put in over the course
of one cycle.

In figure \figref{swingimpulseatres}, compare the amplitude of the cycle immediately following the
first push to the amplitude after the second. Compare the energies as well.

What will happen if you try pushing at 2 Hz? Your first push puts in
some momentum, $p$, but your second push happens after only half a cycle,
when the swing is coming right back at you, with momentum $-p$!
The momentum transfer from the second push is exactly enough to stop
the swing. The result is a very weak, and not
very sinusoidal, motion, \figref{swingimpulsedblres}.

\formatlikesubsubsection{Making the math easy}\\
        This is a simple and physically transparent example of resonance: the swing
        responds most strongly if you match its natural rhythm. However, it has some
        characteristics that are mathematically ugly and possibly unrealistic.
        The quick, hard pushes are known as \emph{impulse} forces, \figref{drivingimpulsive},
        and they lead to an $x$-$t$ graph that has nondifferentiable kinks. Impulsive
        forces like this are not only badly behaved mathematically, they are usually undesirable
        in practical terms. In a car engine, for example, the engineers
        work very hard to make the force on the pistons change smoothly, to avoid excessive
        vibration. Throughout the rest of this section, we'll assume a driving force
        that is sinusoidal, \figref{drivingsine}, i.e., one whose $F$-$t$ graph is either a sine
        function or a function that differs from a sine wave in phase, such as a cosine.
        The force is positive for half of each cycle and negative for the other half, i.e.,
        there is both pushing and pulling. Sinusoidal
        functions have many nice mathematical characteristics (we can differentiate and
        integrate them, and the sum of sinusoidal functions that have the same frequency
        is a sinusoidal function), and they are also used in many practical situations.
        For instance, my garage door zapper sends out a sinusoidal radio wave, and the
        receiver is tuned to resonance with it.

A second mathematical issue that I glossed over in the swing example was how
friction behaves. In section \ref{subsec:forcesbetweensolids}, about forces between
solids, the empirical equation for kinetic friction was independent of velocity.
Fluid friction, on the other hand, is velocity-dependent. For a child on a swing,
fluid friction is the most important form of friction, and is approximately proportional
to $v^2$. In still other situations, e.g., with a low-density gas or friction between solid
surfaces that have been lubricated with a fluid such as oil, we may find that the frictional
force has some other dependence on velocity, perhaps being proportional to $v$, or having
some other complicated velocity dependence that can't even be expressed with a simple
equation.
It would be extremely complicated to have to treat all of these different possibilities
in complete generality, so for the rest of this section, we'll assume friction proportional
to velocity
\begin{equation*}
        F        = -bv\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
simply because the resulting equations happen to be the easiest to solve.
Even when the friction doesn't behave in exactly this way, many of our results
may still be at least qualitatively correct.

<% begin_sec("The quality factor") %>

It's usually impractical to measure $b$ directly and determine $c$ from the equation
$c=b/2m$. For a child on a swing, measuring $b$ would require putting the child
in a wind tunnel! It's usually much easier to characterize the amount of damping by
observing the actual damped oscillations and seeing how many cycles it takes for
the mechanical energy to decrease by a certain factor. The unitless
\emph{quality factor}\index{quality factor}, $Q$, is defined as 
$Q=\omega_\zu{o}/2c$, and in the limit of weak damping, where
$\omega\approx\omega_\zu{o}$, this can be interpreted as
the number of
cycles required for the mechanical energy to fall off by a factor of $e^{2\pi}=535.49\ldots$
Using this new quantity, we can rewrite the equation for the frequency of damped
oscillations in the slightly more elegant form
$\omega_f        = \omega_\zu{o}\sqrt{1-1/4Q^2}$.

<% self_check('q-is-when-dead',<<-'SELF_CHECK'
        What if we wanted to make a simpler definition of $Q$, as the number of oscillations required for
        the vibrations to die out completely, rather than the number required for the energy to
        fall off by this obscure factor?

\begin{eg}{A graph}
The damped motion in figure \figref{damping-effect-on-frequency} has $Q\approx 4.5$,
giving $\sqrt{1-1/4Q^2}\approx 0.99$, as claimed at the end of the preceding subsection.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Exponential decay in a trumpet}
\egquestion
 The vibrations of the air column inside a trumpet
have a $Q$ of about 10. This means that even after the trumpet
player stops blowing, the note will keep sounding for a
short time. If the player suddenly stops blowing, how will
the sound intensity 20 cycles later compare with the sound
intensity while she was still blowing?

\eganswer
 The trumpet's $Q$ is 10, so after 10 cycles the
energy will have fallen off by a factor of 535. After
another 10 cycles we lose another factor of 535, so the
sound intensity is reduced by a factor of 
$535\times535= 2.9\times10^5$.
\end{eg}

The decay of a musical sound is part of what gives it its
character, and a good musical instrument should have the
right $Q$, but the $Q$ that is considered desirable is different
for different instruments. A guitar is meant to keep on
sounding for a long time after a string has been plucked,
and might have a $Q$ of 1000 or 10000. One of the reasons why
a cheap synthesizer sounds so bad is that the sound suddenly
cuts off after a key is released.

The driven case is extremely important in science, technology, and engineering.
We have an external driving force $F=F_m \sin \omega t$, where the constant
$F_m$ indicates the maximum strength of the force in either direction. The equation
of motion is now
\begin{multline}\label{eqn:resonancemotion}
        ma+bv+kx = F_m \sin \omega t \\
                        \qquad \text{[equation of motion for a driven oscillator]}\eqquad.
\end{multline}
After the driving force has been applied for a while, we expect that the amplitude
of the oscillations will approach some constant value. This motion is known as the
\emph{steady state}\index{steady state}\index{oscillations!steady state}, and it's the most
interesting thing to find out; as we'll see later, the most general type of motion is
only a minor variation on the steady-state motion. For the steady-state motion,
we're going to look for a solution of the form
\begin{equation*}
        x = A \sin (\omega{}t+\delta)\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
In contrast to the undriven case, here it's not possible to sweep $A$ and $\delta$ 
under the rug. The amplitude of the steady-state motion, $A$, is actually the
most interesting thing to know about the steady-state motion, and it's not true that we
still have a solution no matter how we fiddle with $A$; if we have a solution for
a certain value of $A$, then multiplying $A$ by some constant would break the
equality between the two sides of the equation of motion. It's also no longer true
that we can get rid of $\delta$ simply be redefining when we start the clock; here
$\delta$ represents a \emph{difference} in time between the start of one cycle of the driving
force and the start of the corresponding cycle of the motion.

The velocity and
acceleration are $v=\omega{}A\cos(\omega  t+\delta)$ and
$a=-\omega^2A\sin(\omega t+\delta)$, and if we plug these into the equation
of motion, \eqref{eqn:resonancemotion}, and simplify a little, we find
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:steadystate}
        (k-m\omega^2)\sin (\omega t+\delta)
                 +\omega b \cos (\omega t+\delta) 
                = \frac{F_m}{A} \sin \omega t\eqquad.
\end{equation}
The sum of any two sinusoidal functions with the same frequency is also
a sinusoidal, so the whole left side adds up to a sinusoidal. By fiddling with
$A$ and $\delta$ we can make the amplitudes and phases of the two sides
of the equation match up.

<% begin_sec("Steady state, no damping") %>

$A$ and $\delta$ are easy to find in the case where there is no damping at all.
There are now no cosines in equation \eqref{eqn:steadystate} above, only sines,
so if we wish we can set $\delta$ to zero, and we find
$A=F_m/(k-m\omega^2)=F_m/m(\omega_\zu{o}^2-\omega^2)$.
This, however, makes $A$ negative for $\omega>\omega_\zu{o}$. 
The variable $\delta$ was designed to represent this kind of phase relationship,
so we prefer to keep $A$ positive and set $\delta=\pi$ for $\omega>\omega_\zu{o}$.
Our results are then
\begin{align*}
        A                &= \frac{F_m}{m\left|\omega^2-\omega_\zu{o}^2\right|} \\
\intertext{and}
        \delta        &= \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 0, & \omega<\omega_\zu{o}\\
                                        \pi, & \omega>\omega_\zu{o}\end{array}\right.\eqquad.

%>
<% end_marg %>

The most important feature of the result is that there is a resonance: the
amplitude becomes greater
and greater, and approaches infinity,
as $\omega$ approaches the resonant frequency $\omega_\zu{o}$.
This is the physical behavior we anticipated on page \pageref{swing-resonance} in the
example of pushing a child on a swing. If the driving frequency matches the frequency of
the free vibrations, then the driving force will always be in the right direction to
add energy to the swing. At a driving frequency very different from the resonant frequency,
we might get lucky and push at the right time during one cycle, but our next push would
come at some random point in the next cycle, possibly having the effect of slowing the swing
down rather than speeding it up.

The interpretation of the infinite amplitude at $\omega=\omega_\zu{o}$ is that there really isn't any steady
state if we drive the system exactly at resonance --- the amplitude will just keep
on increasing indefinitely. In real life, the amplitude can't be infinite both because there is always some damping and because
there will always be some difference, however small, between
$\omega$ and $\omega_\zu{o}$. Even though the infinity is unphysical, it has entered into
the popular consciousness, starting with the eccentric Serbian-American inventor and physicist Nikola Tesla.\index{Tesla!Nikola}
Around 1912, the tabloid newspaper \emph{The World Today} credulously reported a story which Tesla probably fabricated --- or wildly exaggerated ---
for the sake of publicity. Supposedly he created a steam-powered device ``no larger than an alarm clock,'' containing a piston
that could be made to vibrate at a tunable and precisely controlled frequency.
``He put his little vibrator in his coat-pocket and went out to hunt a half-erected steel building. Down in the Wall
Street district, he found one --- ten stories of steel framework without a brick or a stone laid around it. He clamped
the vibrator to one of the beams, and fussed with the adjustment [presumably hunting for the building's resonant frequency] until he got it.
Tesla said finally the structure began to creak and weave and the steel-workers came to the ground panic-stricken, believing
that there had been an earthquake. Police were called out. Tesla put the vibrator in his pocket and went away. Ten
minutes more and he could have laid the building in the street. And, with the same vibrator he could have dropped the Brooklyn Bridge into
the East River in less than an hour.''

The phase angle  $\delta$ also exhibits surprising behavior. As the frequency is tuned upward past resonance,
the phase abruptly shifts so that the phase of the response is opposite to that of the driving force.
There is a simple interpretation for this.
The system's mechanical energy can only
change due to work done by the driving force, since there is no damping
to convert mechanical energy to heat. In the steady state, then, the power
transmitted by the driving force over a full cycle of motion must average out to zero.
In general, the work theorem $\der{}E=F\der{}x$ can always be divided by $\der{}t$
on both sides to give the useful relation $P=Fv$. If $Fv$ is to average out to zero,
then $F$ and $v$ must be out of phase by $\pm\pi/2$, and since $v$ is ahead of
$x$ by a phase angle of $\pi/2$, the phase angle between $x$ and $F$ must be
zero or $\pi$.

Given that  these are the two possible phases, why is there a difference in behavior between $\omega<\omega_\zu{o}$
and $\omega>\omega_\zu{o}$? At the low-frequency limit, consider $\omega=0$, i.e., a constant force.
A constant force will simply displace the oscillator to one side, reaching an equilibrium that is offset from
the usual one. The force and the response are in phase, e.g., if the force is to the right, the equilibrium
will be offset to the right. This is the situation depicted in the amplitude graph of figure \figref{resonance-undamped}
at $\omega=0$. The response, which is not zero, is simply this static displacement of the oscillator to one side.

At high frequencies, on the other hand, imagine shaking the poor child on the swing back and forth with a force
that oscillates at 10 Hz. This is so fast that there is essentially no time for the force $F=-kx$ from gravity and
the chain to act from one cycle to the next. The problem becomes equivalent to the oscillation of a \emph{free}
object. If the driving force varies like $\sin(\omega t)$, with $\delta=0$, then the acceleration is also
proportional to the sine. Integrating, we find that the velocity goes like minus a cosine, and a second
integration gives a position that varies as minus the sine --- opposite in phase to the driving force.
Intuitively, this mathematical result corresponds to the fact that at the moment when the object has reached
its maximum displacement to the \emph{right}, that is the time when the greatest force is being applied to the
\emph{left}, in order to turn it around and bring it back toward the center.

       \begin{eg}{A practice mute for a violin}\label{eg:violin-mute}
       The amplitude of the driven vibrations, $A=F_m/(m|\omega^2-\omega_\zu{o}^2|)$, contains
       an inverse proportionality to the mass of the vibrating object. This is simply because
       a given force will produce less acceleration when applied to a more massive object.
       An application is shown in figure \ref{eg:violin-mute}.  

       In a stringed instrument, the strings themselves don't have
       enough surface area to excite sound waves very efficiently.
       In instruments of the violin family, as the strings vibrate from left to right, they cause the
       bridge (the piece of wood they pass over)
       to wiggle clockwise and counterclockwise, and this motion is transmitted to the top panel
       of the instrument, which vibrates and creates sound waves in the air.

       A string player who wants to practice
       at night without bothering the neighbors can add some mass to the bridge.
       Adding mass to the bridge causes the
       amplitude of the vibrations to be smaller, and the sound to be much softer.
       A similar effect is seen when an electric guitar is used without an amp. The body
       of an electric guitar is so much more massive than the body of an acoustic guitar that
       the amplitude of its vibrations is very small.

weaker when there is more damping, since the steady state is reached when

What is surprising is that the amplitude is strongly affected by damping close
to resonance, but only weakly affected far from it. In other words, the shape of
the resonance curve is broader with more damping, and even if we were to scale up
a high-damping curve so that its maximum was the same as that of a low-damping
curve, it would still have a different shape. The standard way of describing the shape
numerically is to give the quantity $\Delta\omega$, called the
 \emph{full width at half-maximum}\index{full width at half-maximum},
or FWHM\index{FWHM}, which is defined in figure \figref{fwhm-omega}. Note that
the $y$ axis is energy, which is proportional to the square of the amplitude.
Our previous observations amount to a statement that $\Delta\omega$ is greater
when the damping is stronger, i.e., when the $Q$ is lower. It's not hard to
show from the equations on page  \pageref{misc:steadystate} that for
large $Q$, the FWHM is given approximately by
\begin{equation*}
        \Delta\omega \approx \omega_\zu{o}/Q\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

Another thing we notice in figure \figref{resonance} is that for small values of $Q$
the frequency $\omega_{res}$ of the maximum $A$ is
less than $\omega_\zu{o}$.\footnote{The relationship is $\omega_{max\ A}/\omega_\zu{o}=\sqrt{1-1/2Q^2}$,
which is similar in form to the equation for the frequency of the free vibration, $\omega_{f}/\omega_\zu{o}=\sqrt{1-1/4Q^2}$. A subtle point here is that
although the maximum of $A$ and the maximum of $A^2$ must occur at the same frequency, the maximum energy does not occur, as we might expect, at the same
frequency as the maximum of $A^2$. This is because the interaction energy is proportional to $A^2$ regardless of frequency, but the kinetic energy is
proportional to $A^2\omega^2$. The maximum energy actually occurs are precisely $\omega_\zu{o}$.}
At even lower values of $Q$, like $Q=1$, the $A-\omega$ curve doesn't even have a maximum
near $\omega>0$.

glass to use for this display of her prowess, she should look for one that

Figure \figref{nimitz} shows a section
of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland, CA, that collapsed during an
earthquake in 1989.
An earthquake consists of many low-frequency vibrations that
occur simultaneously, which is why it sounds like a rumble
of indeterminate pitch rather than a low hum. The
frequencies that we can hear are not even the strongest
ones; most of the energy is in the form of vibrations in the
range of frequencies from about 1 Hz to 10 Hz.

All the structures we build are resting on geological
layers of dirt, mud, sand, or rock. When an earthquake wave
comes along, the topmost layer acts like a system with a
certain natural frequency of vibration, sort of like a cube
of jello on a plate being shaken from side to side. The
resonant frequency of the layer depends on how stiff it is
and also on how deep it is. The ill-fated section of the
Nimitz freeway was built on a layer of mud, and analysis by
geologist Susan E. Hough of the U.S. Geological Survey shows
that the mud layer's resonance was centered on about 2.5 Hz,
and had a width covering a range from about 1 Hz to 4 Hz.

When the earthquake wave came along with its mixture of
frequencies, the mud responded strongly to those that were
close to its own natural 2.5 Hz frequency. Unfortunately, an
engineering analysis after the quake showed that the
overpass itself had a resonant frequency of 2.5 Hz as well!
The mud responded strongly to the earthquake waves with
frequencies close to 2.5 Hz, and the bridge responded
strongly to the 2.5 Hz vibrations of the mud, causing
sections of it to collapse.

<% begin_sec("Physical reason for the relationship between Q and the FWHM") %>

What is the reason for this surprising relationship between the damping and
the width of the resonance? Fundamentally, it has to do with the fact that
friction causes a system to lose its ``memory'' of its previous state. If the Pioneer
10 space probe, coasting through the frictionless vacuum of interplanetary space,
is detected by aliens a million years from now, they will be able to trace its
trajectory backwards and infer that it came from our solar system. On the other hand,
imagine that I shove a book along a tabletop, it comes to rest, and then someone
else walks into the room. There will be no clue as to which direction the book was moving
before it stopped --- friction has erased its memory of its motion.
Now consider the playground swing driven at twice its natural frequency,
figure \figref{swingimpulsedamp}, where
the undamped case is repeated from figure \figref{swingimpulsedblres} on page
\pageref{fig:swingimpulsedblres}. 
In the undamped case, the first push starts the swing moving with momentum $p$,
but when the
second push comes,  if there
is no friction at all, it now has a momentum of exactly $-p$, and the momentum transfer
from the second push is exactly enough to stop it dead. With moderate damping, however,
the momentum on the rebound is not quite $-p$, and the second push's effect isn't
quite as disastrous. With very strong damping, the swing comes essentially to rest long before
the second push. It has lost all its memory, and the second push puts energy into the
system rather than taking it out. Although the detailed mathematical results with this
kind of impulsive driving force are different,\footnote{For example, the graphs calculated
for sinusoidal driving have resonances that are somewhat below the natural frequency, 
getting lower with increasing damping, until for $Q\le1$ the maximum response occurs
at $\omega=0$. In figure \figref{swingimpulsedamp}, however, we can see that impulsive
driving at $\omega=2\omega_\zu{o}$ produces a steady state with more energy
than at $\omega=\omega_\zu{o}$.}
the general results are the same
as for sinusoidal driving: the less damping there is, the greater the penalty you pay
for driving the system off of resonance.

        the speakers might be more expensive, and a high-$Q$ speaker also
        has less friction, so it wastes less energy as heat.

        One problem with this is that whereas the resonance
        curve of a low-$Q$ speaker (its ``response curve'' 
        or ``frequency response'' in audiophile lingo) is
        fairly flat, a higher-$Q$ speaker tends to emphasize the frequencies
        that are close to its natural resonance. In audio, a flat response curve
        gives more realistic reproduction of sound, so a higher quality factor, $Q$,
        really corresponds to a \emph{lower\/}-quality speaker.

        Another problem with high-$Q$ speakers is discussed in example
        \ref{eg:boomyspeakers} on page \pageref{eg:boomyspeakers} .

\begin{eg}{Changing the pitch of a wind instrument}
\egquestion
 A saxophone player normally selects which note to
play by choosing a certain fingering, which gives the
saxophone a certain resonant frequency. The musician can
also, however, change the pitch significantly by altering
the tightness of her lips. This corresponds to driving the
horn slightly off of resonance. If the pitch can be altered
by about 5\% up or down (about one musical half-step) without
too much effort, roughly what is the $Q$ of a saxophone?

\eganswer
 Five percent is the width on one side of the
resonance, so the full width is about 10\%, $\Delta f/f_\zu{o}\approx 0.1$.
The equation $\Delta\omega=\omega_\zu{o}/ Q$ is defined in terms of
angular frequency, $\omega=2\pi\ f$, and we've been given our
data in terms of ordinary frequency, $f$. The factors of $2\pi$ end up canceling out,
however:
\begin{align*}
         Q        &= \frac{\omega_\zu{o}}{\Delta\omega} \\
                        & = \frac{2\pi f_\zu{o}}{2\pi\Delta f} \\
                        & = \frac{f_\zu{o}}{f} \\
                        & \approx 10
\end{align*}
In other words, once the musician stops
blowing, the horn will continue sounding for about 10 cycles
before its energy falls off by a factor of 535. (Blues and
jazz saxophone players will typically choose a mouthpiece
that gives a low $Q$, so that they can produce the bluesy
pitch-slides typical of their style. ``Legit,'' i.e.,
classically oriented players, use a higher-$Q$ setup because
their style only calls for enough pitch variation to produce
a vibrato, and the higher $Q$ makes it easier to play in tune.)

\egquestion
 A radio receiver used in the FM band needs to be
tuned in to within about 0.1 MHz for signals at about 100
MHz. What is its $Q$?

\eganswer
As in the last example, we're given data in terms of $f$s, not
$\omega$s, but the factors of $2\pi$ cancel. The resulting
$Q$ is about 1000, which is extremely high compared to the
$Q$ values of most mechanical systems.

What about the motion before the steady state is achieved? When we computed
the undriven motion numerically on page 
\pageref{freedampednumerical}, the program had to initialize the position and
velocity. By changing these two variables, we could have gotten any of an
infinite number of simulations.\footnote{If you've learned about differential equations,
you'll know that any second-order differential equation requires the specification
of two boundary conditions in order to specify solution uniquely.}
The same is true when we have an equation of motion with a driving term,
$ma+bv+kx = F_m \sin \omega{}t$ (p. \pageref{eqn:resonancemotion}, equation
\eqref{eqn:resonancemotion}). The steady-state solutions, however, have no
adjustable parameters at all --- $A$ and $\delta$ are uniquely determined
by the parameters of the driving force and the oscillator itself. If the oscillator
isn't initially in the steady state, then it will not have the steady-state motion
at first. What kind of motion will it have?

The answer comes from realizing that if we start with the solution to the driven
equation of motion, and then add to it any solution to the free equation of motion,
the result,
\begin{equation*}
                x = A \sin (\omega t+\delta) + A' e^{-ct}\sin (\omega_f t+\delta')\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
is also a solution of the driven equation. Here, as before,
$\omega_f$
is the frequency of the free oscillations ($\omega_f\approx\omega_\zu{o}$
for small $Q$), $\omega$ is the frequency of the driving force,
$A$ and $\delta$ are related as usual to the parameters of the driving
force, and $A'$ and $\delta'$ can have any values at all. Given the initial
position and velocity, we can always choose $A'$ and $\delta'$ to reproduce
them, but this is not something one often has to do in real life. What's more
important is to realize that the second term dies out exponentially over time,
decaying at the same rate at which a free vibration would. For this reason,
the $A'$ term is called a transient. A high-$Q$ oscillator's transients take a
long time to die out, while a low-$Q$ oscillator always settles down to its
steady state very quickly.  

\begin{eg}{Boomy bass}\label{eg:boomyspeakers}
        In example \ref{eg:highqspeakers} on page \pageref{eg:highqspeakers},
        I've already discussed one of the drawbacks of a high-$Q$ speaker,
        which is an uneven response curve.
        Another problem is that in a high-$Q$ speaker, transients take a long
        time to die out. The bleeding-eardrums crowd tend to focus mostly
        on making their bass loud, so it's usually their woofers that have
        high $Q$s. The result is that bass notes, 
        ``ring'' after the onset of the note, a phenomenon referred to as ``boomy bass.''

<% begin_sec("Overdamped motion") %>

The treatment of free, damped motion on page \pageref{freedampedanalytic}
skipped over a subtle point: in the equation
$\omega_f = \sqrt{k/m-b^2/4m^2} = 
        \omega_\zu{o}\sqrt{1-1/4Q^2}$, $Q<1/2$ results in an answer that
is the square root of a negative number. For example, suppose we had
$k=0$, which corresponds to a neutral equilibrium. A physical example
would be a mass sitting in a tub of syrup. If we set it in motion,
it won't oscillate --- it will simply slow to a stop. This system
has $Q=0$. The equation of motion
in this case is $ma+bv=0$, or, more suggestively,
\begin{equation*}
        m\frac{\der{}v}{\der{}t}+bv=0\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
One can easily verify that this has the solution
$v=\text{(constant)}e^{-bt/m}$, and integrating, we find 
$x=\text{(constant)}e^{-bt/m}+\text{(constant)}$. In other words,
the reason $\omega_f$ comes out to be mathematical nonsense\footnote{Actually,
if you know about complex numbers and Euler's theorem, it's not quite so
nonsensical.} is that we were incorrect in assuming a solution that oscillated at a frequency
$\omega_f$. The actual motion is not oscillatory at all.

In general, systems with $Q<1/2$, called
overdamped\index{oscillations!overdamped!mechanical}%
\index{overdamped oscillations!mechanical}\index{damped oscillations!overdamped!mechanical}
 systems, do not
display oscillatory motion. Most cars' shock absorbers are designed with
$Q\approx1/2$, since it's undesirable for the car to undulate up and down for
a while after you go over a bump. (Shocks with extremely low values of $Q$ are not good
either, because such a system takes a very long time to come back to
equilibrium.) It's not particularly important for our purposes, but for completeness
I'll note, as you can easily verify, that the general solution to the equation of motion
for $0<Q<1/2$ is of the form $x=Ae^{-ct}+Be^{-dt}$, while
$Q=1/2$, called the critically damped\index{critically damped}\index{damping!critical}%
\index{damped oscillations!critically damped} case, gives $x=(A+Bt)e^{-ct}$.\label{overdamped}

When my friends and I were bored in high school, we used to play a paper-and-pencil
game which, although we never knew it, was Very Educational --- in fact, it
pretty much embodies the entire world-view of classical physics. To play the
game, you draw a racetrack
on graph paper, and try to get your car around the track before anyone else.
The default is for your car to continue at constant speed in a straight
line, so if it moved three squares to the right and one square up on your last turn, it will do the
same this turn. You can also control the car's motion by changing its $\Delta x$
and $\Delta y$ by up to one unit. If it moved three squares to the right last turn,
you can have it move anywhere from two to four squares to the right this turn.

\index{Descartes, Ren\'e}
The fundamental way of dealing with the direction of an object's motion in physics
is to use conservation of momentum, since momentum depends on direction.
Up until now, we've only done momentum in one dimension. How does this
relate to the racetrack game? In the game, the motion of a car from one turn to the
next is represented by its $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$. In one dimension, we would only need
$\Delta x$, which could be related to the velocity, $\Delta x/\Delta t$, and the momentum,
$m\Delta x/\Delta t$. In two dimensions, the rules of the game amount to a statement
that if there is no momentum transfer, then both $m\Delta x/\Delta t$
and $m\Delta y/\Delta t$ stay the same. In other words, there are two flavors of
momentum, and they are \emph{separately} conserved. 
All of this so far has been done with an artificial division of time into ``turns,'' but
we can fix that by redefining everything in terms of derivatives, and for motion in
three dimensions rather than two, we augment $x$ and $y$ with $z$:
\begin{align*}
        v_x &= \der x/\der t        & v_y &= \der y/\der t        & v_z &= \der z/\der t \\
\intertext{and} 
        p_x &= mv_x        &        p_y &= mv_y        &p_z &= mv_z        
\end{align*}
We call these the $x$, $y$, and $z$ components\index{component}
of the velocity and the momentum.

There is both experimental and theoretical evidence that the  $x$, $y$, and $z$
momentum components are separately conserved, and that a momentum transfer
(force) along one axis has no effect on the momentum components along the other
two axes. On page \pageref{subsec:predictingdirection}, for example, I argued that
it was impossible for an air hockey puck to make a 180-degree turn spontaneously,
because then in the frame moving along with the puck, it would have begun moving
after starting from rest. Now that we're working in two dimensions, we might wonder
whether the puck could spontaneously make a 90-degree turn, but exactly the same
line of reasoning shows that this would be impossible as well, which proves that
the puck can't trade $x$-momentum for $y$-momentum. A more general proof
of separate conservation will be given on page \pageref{separatepconsproof},
after some of the appropriate 
mathematical techniques have been introduced.

As an example of the experimental evidence for separate conservation of the momentum
components, figure \figref{bullets} shows correct and incorrect predictions of what happens
if you shoot a rifle and arrange for a second
bullet to be dropped from the same height at exactly the same
moment when the first one left the barrel. 
Nearly everyone expects that the dropped
bullet will reach the dirt first, and Aristotle would have
agreed, since he believed that the bullet had to lose its horizontal motion before
it could start moving vertically. In reality, we find that the vertical momentum transfer
between the earth and the bullet is completely unrelated to the horizontal momentum.
The bullet ends up with $p_y<0$, while the planet picks up an upward momentum
$p_y>0$, and the total momentum in the $y$ direction remains zero. 
Both bullets hit the ground at the same time. This is much simpler
than the Aristotelian version!\index{Aristotle}

\begin{eg}{The Pelton waterwheel}
\egquestion
There is a general class of machines that either 
do work on  a gas or
liquid, like a boat's propeller, or have work done
on them by a gas or liquid, like the turbine in a hydroelectric
power plant. Figure \figref{peltonwheel} shows two types of
surfaces that could be attached to the circumference of an
old-fashioned waterwheel. Compare the force exerted by the water
in the two cases.

\eganswer
Let the $x$ axis point to the right, and the $y$ axis up.
In both cases, the stream of water rushes down onto the surface
with momentum $p_{y,i}=- p_\zu{o}$,
where the subscript $i$ stands for ``initial,'' i.e., before the
collision.

In the case of surface 1, the streams of water leaving the
surface have no momentum in the $y$ direction, and their
momenta in the $x$ direction cancel. The final momentum
of the water is zero along both axes, so its entire momentum,
$- p_\zu{o}$, has been transferred to the waterwheel.

When the water leaves surface 2, however, its momentum
isn't zero. If we assume there is no friction,
it's $p_{y,f}= +p_\zu{o}$, with the positive
sign indicating upward momentum. The change in the
water's momentum is $p_{y,f}- p_{y,i}=2 p_\zu{o}$,
and the momentum transferred to the waterwheel is $-2 p_\zu{o}$.

Force is defined as the rate of transfer of momentum, so
surface 2 experiences double the force. A waterwheel constructed
in this way is known as a Pelton waterwheel.\index{Pelton waterwheel}

\begin{eg}{The Yarkovsky effect}\label{eg:yarkovsky}\index{Yarkovsky effect}\index{asteroid}
We think of the planets and asteroids as inhabiting their orbits permanently, but
it is possible for an orbit to change over periods of millions or billions of years,
due to a variety of effects. For asteroids with diameters
of a few meters or less, an important mechanism is the Yarkovsky effect,
which is easiest to understand if we consider an asteroid
spinning about an axis that is exactly perpendicular to its orbital plane.  

The illuminated side of the asteroid is relatively hot, and radiates more infrared
light than the dark (night) side. Light has momentum, and a total force away from
the sun is produced by combined effect
of the sunlight hitting the asteroid and the imbalance between the momentum
radiated away on the two sides. This force, however, doesn't cause the asteroid's
orbit to change over time, since it simply cancels a tiny fraction of the sun's gravitational
attraction. The result is merely a tiny, undetectable violation of Kepler's law of
periods.

Consider the sideways momentum transfers, however. In figure
\figref{yarkovsky}, the part of the asteroid on the right has been illuminated
for half a spin-period (half a ``day'') by the sun, and is hot. It radiates
more light than the morning side on the left. This imbalance produces a total
force in the $x$ direction which points to the left. If the asteroid's orbital
motion is to the left, then this is a force in the same direction as the motion,
which will do positive work, increasing the asteroid's energy and boosting it
into an orbit with a greater radius. On the other hand, if the asteroid's spin and
orbital motion are in opposite directions, the Yarkovsky push brings the asteroid
spiraling in closer to the sun.

Calculations show that it takes on the order of $10^7$ to $10^8$ years
for the Yarkovsky effect to move an asteroid out of the asteroid belt and into the
vicinity of earth's orbit, and this is about the same as the typical age of a meteorite
as estimated by its exposure to cosmic rays. The Yarkovsky effect doesn't remove
all the asteroids from the asteroid belt, because many of them have orbits that are
stabilized by gravitational interactions with Jupiter. However, when collisions occur,
the fragments can end up in orbits which are not stabilized in this way, and they
may then end up reaching the earth due to the Yarkovsky effect. The cosmic-ray
technique is really telling us how long it has been since the fragment was broken
out of its parent.

\index{rotational invariance}\index{invariance!rotational}
The Cartesian approach requires that we choose $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes.
How do we choose them correctly? The answer is that it had better not matter
which directions the axes point (provided they're perpendicular to each other),
or where we put the origin, because  if it did matter,
it would mean that space was asymmetric. If there was a certain point in the universe
that was the right place to put the origin, where would it be? The top of
Mount Olympus? The United Nations headquarters? We find that
experiments come out the same no matter where we do them, and regardless of
which way the laboratory is oriented, which indicates that no location in space or
direction in space is special in any way.\footnote{Of course, 
you could tell in a sealed laboratory
which way was down, but that's because there happens to be a big planet  nearby,
and the planet's gravitational field reaches into the lab, not because space itself
has a special down direction. Similarly, if your experiment was sensitive to
magnetic fields, it might matter which way the building was oriented, but that's
because the earth makes a magnetic field, not because space itself comes
equipped with a north direction.}

This is closely related to the idea of Galilean
relativity stated on page \pageref{sec:galileanrelativity}, from which we already
know that the absolute \emph{motion} of a frame of reference is irrelevant and undetectable.
Observers using frames of reference that are in motion relative to each other will
not even agree on the permanent identity of a particular point in space, so it's not
possible for the laws of physics to depend on where you are in space. For instance,
if gravitational energies were proportional to $m_1m_2$ in one location but to
$(m_1m_2)^{1.00001}$ in another, then it would be possible to determine when you
were in a state of absolute motion, because the behavior of gravitational interactions
would change as you moved from one region to the other.

\index{Galileo!Galilean relativity}\index{relativity!Galilean}
Because of this close relationship, we restate the principle of Galilean
relativity in a more general form.
 This extended principle of Galilean relativity states that the laws of physics
are no different in one
time and place than in another, and that they also don't depend on your
orientation or your motion, provided that your motion is in a straight line and at
constant speed.

The irrelevance of time and place could have been stated in chapter \ref{ch:1}, but since this
section is the first one in which we're dealing with three-dimensional physics
in full generality, the irrelevance of orientation is what we really care about right
now. This property of the laws of physics is called rotational invariance. The word
``invariance'' means a lack of change, i.e., the laws of physics don't change when
we reorient our frame of reference.

        \begin{eg}{Rotational invariance of gravitational interactions}
        Gravitational energies depend on the quantity 1/$r$, which by the
        Py\-thag\-or\-e\-an theorem equals
        \begin{equation*}
                 \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Delta x^2+\Delta y^2+\Delta z^2}}
\eqquad.
        \end{equation*}
        Rotating a line segment doesn't change its length, so this expression
        comes out the same regardless of which way we orient our coordinate axes.
        Even though $\Delta x$, $\Delta y$, and $\Delta z$ are different
        in differently oriented coordinate systems, $r$ is the same.

\begin{eg}{Kinetic energy}\label{eg:ke3d}
        Kinetic energy equals $\zu{(1/2)} mv^2$, but what does that mean
        in three dimensions, where we have $v_x$, $v_y$, and
        $v_z$? If you were tempted to add the components and calculate
        $K=(1/2) m( v_x+ v_y+ v_z)^2$,
        figure \figref{rolldowncone} should convince you otherwise. Using that
        method, we'd have to assign a kinetic energy of zero to ball number 1,
        since its negative $v_y$ would exactly cancel its positive $v_x$,
        whereas ball number 2's kinetic energy wouldn't be zero. This would violate
        rotational invariance, since the balls would behave differently.

                The only possible way to generalize kinetic energy to three dimensions,
                without violating rotational invariance, is to  use an expression that
                resembles the Pythagorean theorem,
                \begin{equation*}
                         v=\sqrt{ v_{x}^2+ v_{y}^2+ v_z^2}\eqquad,
                \end{equation*}
                which results in
                \begin{equation*}
                         K=\frac{1}{2} m
                        \left( v_{x}^2+ v_{y}^2+ v_z^2\right)
\eqquad.
                \end{equation*}
                Since the velocity components are squared, the positive and negative signs
                don't matter, and the two balls in the example behave the same way.

physically useful way to talk about the strength of the magnetic field is
to define it as $\sqrt{B_x^2+B_y^2+B_z^2}$. Nature knows your
brain cells are precious, and doesn't want you to have to waste them
by memorizing mathematical rules that are different for magnetic fields
than for velocities.

When mathematicians see that the same set of techniques is useful in
many different contexts, that's when they start making definitions that
allow them to stop reinventing the wheel. The ancient Greeks, for example,
had no general concept of fractions. They couldn't say that a circle's
radius divided by its diameter was equal to the number 1/2. They had to
say that the radius and the diameter were in the ratio of one to two. With this
limited number concept, they couldn't have said that water was dripping out
of a tank at a rate of 3/4 of a barrel per day; instead, they would have had to say
that over four days, three barrels worth of water would be lost. Once enough of
these situations came up, some clever mathematician finally realized that
it would make sense to define something called a fraction, and that one could
think of these fraction thingies as numbers that lay in the gaps between the traditionally
recognized numbers like zero, one, and two. Later generations of mathematicians
introduced further subversive generalizations of the number concepts, inventing
mathematical creatures like negative numbers, and the square root of two, which
can't be expressed as a fraction.

In this spirit, we define a \emph{vector}\index{vector!defined} as any quantity that has
both an amount and a direction in space. In contradistinction, a
\emph{scalar}\index{scalar!defined} has an amount, but no direction. Time and
temperature are scalars. Velocity, acceleration, momentum, and force are vectors.
In one dimension,
there are only two possible directions, and we can use positive and negative numbers
to indicate the two directions. In more than one dimension, there are infinitely many
possible directions, so we can't use the two symbols $+$ and $-$ to
indicate the direction of a vector. Instead, we can specify the three components
of the vector, each of which can be either negative or positive.
We represent vector quantities in handwriting by writing an
 arrow above them, so for example the
momentum vector looks like this, $\vec{p}$,
but the arrow looks ugly in print, so in books vectors are usually
 shown in bold-face type: \vc{p}.
A straightforward way of thinking about vectors is that a vector equation really
represents three different equations. For instance, conservation of momentum
could be written in terms of the three components,
\begin{align*}
        \Delta p_x        &= 0 \\
        \Delta p_y        &= 0 \\
        \Delta p_z        &= 0\eqquad,
\end{align*}
or as a single vector equation,\footnote{The zero here is really a zero
\emph{vector}, i.e., a vector whose components are all zero, so we should
really represent it with a boldface \vc{0}. There's usually not much danger of
confusion, however, so most books, including this one, don't use boldface for the
zero vector.}
\begin{equation*}
        \Delta \mathbf{p} = 0\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
The following table summarizes some vector operations.

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{65mm}|}
\hline
\textsl{operation}        & \textsl{definition} \\
\hline
$|\mathbf{vector}|$        & $\sqrt{vector_x^2+vector_y^2+vector_z^2}$ \\

$\mathbf{vector}\ /\ scalar        $        & Divide each component by the scalar. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\noindent{}The first of these is called the \emph{magnitude} of the vector; in one dimension,
where a vector only has one component, it amounts to taking the absolute value,
hence the similar notation.

\begin{eg}{An explosion}\label{eg:kaboom}
\egquestion 
Astronomers observe the planet Mars as the
Martians fight a nuclear war. The Martian bombs are so
powerful that they rip the planet into three separate pieces
of liquefied rock, all having the same mass. If one fragment
flies off with velocity components $v_{1 x}=0$,
$v_{1 y}\zu{=1.0x10}^4$ km/hr,
and the second with $v_{2 x}\zu{=1.0x10}^4$ km/hr, 
$v_{2 y}=0$, what is the
magnitude of the third one's velocity?

\eganswer 
We work the problem in the center of mass frame,
in which the planet initially had zero momentum. After the
explosion, the vector sum of the momenta must still be zero.
Vector addition can be done by adding components, so
\begin{align*}
         mv_{1 x} +  mv_{2 x} +  mv_{3 x}  &=  0   \\
\intertext{and}
         mv_{1 y} +  mv_{2 y} +  mv_{3 y} &=  0\eqquad,
\end{align*}
where we have used the same symbol $m$ for all the terms,
because the fragments all have the same mass. The masses can
be eliminated by dividing each equation by $m$, and we find
\begin{align*}
         v_{3 x}  &=  -\zu{1.0x10}^4\ \zu{km/hr} \\
         v_{3 y}  &=  -\zu{1.0x10}^4\ \zu{km/hr}\eqquad,
\end{align*}
which gives a magnitude of
\begin{align*}
        |\vc{v}_3|        &= \sqrt{ v_{3 x}^2+ v_{3 y}^2} \\
        &=  \zu{1.4x10}^4\ \zu{km/hr}\eqquad.

\begin{eg}{A toppling box}\label{eg:toppling-box}
If you place a box on a frictionless surface, it will fall
over with a very complicated motion that is hard to predict
in detail. We know, however, that its center of mass's motion is
related to its momentum, and the rate at which momentum is transferred
is the force. Moreover, we know that these relationships apply separately
to each component. Let $x$ and $y$ be horizontal, and $z$ vertical. There
are two forces on the box, an upward force from the table and a downward gravitational force.
Since both of these are along the $z$ axis, $p_z$ is the only component of the
box's momentum that can change. We conclude that the center
of mass travels vertically. This is true even if the box
bounces and tumbles. [Based on an example by Kleppner and Kolenkow.]

A vector in two dimensions can be easily visualized by
drawing an arrow whose length represents its magnitude and
whose direction represents its direction. The $x$ component of
a vector can then be visualized, \figref{flashlight}, as the length of the shadow
it would cast in a beam of light projected onto the $x$ axis,
and similarly for the $y$ component. Shadows with arrowheads
pointing back against the direction of the positive axis
correspond to negative components.

In this type of diagram, the negative of a vector is the
vector with the same magnitude but in the opposite
direction. Multiplying a vector by a scalar is represented
by lengthening the arrow by that factor, and similarly for
division.

\begin{eg}[4]{A useless vector operation}
The way I've defined the various vector operations above aren't as arbitrary as they seem.  
There are many different
vector operations that we could define, but only some of the possible definitions
are mathematically useful. Consider the operation of
multiplying two vectors component by component to produce a
third vector:
\begin{align*}
         R_{x} & =   P_{x}  Q_x        \\
         R_{y} & =   P_{y}  Q_y        \\

                      in two different frames of reference, 2 and 3.
    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

As a simple example, we choose vectors \vc{P} and \vc{Q} to have
length 1, and make them perpendicular to each other, as
shown in figure \figref{useless}/1. If we compute the result of our new
vector operation using the coordinate system shown in \figref{useless}/2,
we find:
\begin{align*}
         R_{x}  &=  0 \\
         R_{y}  &=  0 \\
         R_z  &=  0 
\end{align*}
The $x$ component is zero because $P_x =0$, the $y$ component is
zero because $Q_y=0$, and the $z$ component is of course zero
because both vectors are in the $x$-$y$ plane. However, if we
carry out the same operations in coordinate system \figref{useless}/3,
rotated 45 degrees with respect to the previous one, we find
\begin{align*}
         R_{x}  &=  -\zu{1/2} \\
         R_{y}  &=  \zu{1/2} \\
         R_z  &=  0 
\end{align*}
The operation's result depends on what coordinate system we
use, and since the two versions of \vc{R} have different lengths
(one being zero and the other nonzero), they don't just
represent the same answer expressed in two different
coordinate systems. Such an operation will never be useful
in physics, because experiments show physics works the same
regardless of which way we orient the laboratory building!
The useful vector operations, such as addition and scalar
multiplication, are rotationally invariant, i.e., come out
the same regardless of the orientation of the coordinate
system.
\end{eg}

All the vector techniques can be applied to any kind of vector, but
the graphical representation of vectors as arrows is particularly
natural for vectors that represent lengths and distances.
We define a vector called $\vc{r}$ whose components are the
coordinates of a particular point in space, $x$, $y$, and $z$.
The $\Delta\vc{r}$ vector,
whose components are $\Delta x$, $\Delta y$,
and $\Delta z$, can then be used to represent motion that starts
at one point and ends at another. Adding two $\Delta \vc{r}$ vectors
is interpreted as a trip with two legs: by computing the $\Delta \vc{r}$
vector going from point A to point B plus the vector from B to C,
we find the vector that would have taken us directly from A to C.

If you ask someone where Las Vegas is compared to Los
Angeles, she is unlikely to say that the $\Delta x$ is 290 km and
the $\Delta y$ is 230 km, in a coordinate system where the positive
$x$ axis is east and the $y$ axis points north. She will
probably say instead that it's 370 km to the northeast. If
she was being precise, she might specify the direction as
$38\degunit$ counterclockwise from east. In two dimensions, we can
always specify a vector's direction like this, using a
single angle. A magnitude plus an angle suffice to specify
everything about the vector. The following two examples show
how we use trigonometry and the Pythagorean theorem to go
back and forth between the $x$-$y$ and magnitude-angle
descriptions of vectors.

\begin{eg}{Finding magnitude and angle from components}\label{eg:comptopolar}
\egquestion
 Given that the $\Delta\vc{r}$ vector from LA to Las Vegas has $\Delta x$=290 km 
and $\Delta y$=230 km,
how would we find the magnitude and direction of $\Delta\vc{r}$?

\eganswer
 We find the magnitude of $\Delta\vc{r}$ from the Pythagorean theorem:
\begin{align*}
        |\Delta\vc{r}|        &= \sqrt{\Delta x^2+\Delta y^2} \\
                &= 370\ \zu{km}
\end{align*}
We know all three sides of the triangle, so the angle $\theta$ can be found using 
any of the inverse trig functions. For example, we know the opposite and adjacent sides, so
\begin{align*}
        \theta         &= \zu{tan}^{-1} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\\
                &= 38\degunit\eqquad.

 that the angle $\theta$ in the figure is 38\degunit, how can the $x$ and $y$ components
 of the $\Delta\vc{r}$ vector be found?

\eganswer
 The sine and cosine of $\theta$ relate the given information to the information we wish to find:
\begin{align*}
        \zu{cos}\ \theta        &= \frac{\Delta x}{|\Delta\vc{r}|}\\
        \zu{sin}\ \theta        &= \frac{\Delta y}{|\Delta\vc{r}|}
\end{align*}
Solving for the unknowns gives
\begin{align*}
        \Delta x        &= |\Delta\vc{r}|\:\zu{cos}\ \theta\\
                &= 290\ \zu{km}\\
        \Delta y        &= |\Delta\vc{r}|\:\zu{sin}\ \theta\\
                &= 230\ \zu{km}
\end{align*}

which is usually the main cause of mistakes by students.

\eganswer
 If we make the traditional choice of coordinate axes, with $x$ pointing to the right and $y$
 pointing up on the map, then her $\Delta x$ is negative, because her final $x$ value 
is less than her initial $x$ value. Her $\Delta y$ is positive, so we have
\begin{align*}
        \Delta x         &= -120\ \zu{km}\\
        \Delta y        &= 150\ \zu{km}\eqquad.
\end{align*}

If we work by analogy with the example \ref{eg:comptopolar}, we get
\begin{align*}
        \theta        &= \zu{tan}^{-1} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\\
                &= \zu{tan}^{-1}\left(- 1.25\right) \\
                &= -51\degunit\eqquad.
\end{align*}
According to the usual way of defining angles in trigonometry, a negative result means 
an angle that lies clockwise from the $x$ axis, which would have her heading for the Baja
 California. What went wrong? The answer is that when you ask your calculator to take
 the arctangent of a number, there are always two valid possibilities differing by 
180\degunit. That is, there are two possible angles whose tangents equal -1.25:
\begin{align*}
        \zu{tan}\ 129\degunit &= - 1.25 \\
        \zu{tan}\left(-51\degunit\right) &= - 1.25
\end{align*}
You calculator doesn't know which is the correct one, so it just picks one. In this case,
 the one it picked was the wrong one, and it was up to you to add $180\degunit$ to it to
 find the right answer.

If the hand, with length $\ell$, is represented by a $\Delta\vc{r}$ vector
going from the dial's center to the tip of the hand,
find this vector's $\Delta x$.

\eganswer The following shortcut is the easiest way to work out examples like
these, in which a vector's direction is known relative to one of the axes.
We can tell that $\Delta\vc{r}$ will have a large, negative $x$ component
and a small, positive $y$.
Since $\Delta x<0$,  there are really only
two logical possibilities: either $\Delta x = -\ell \cos\phi$, or
$\Delta x = -\ell \sin\phi$. Because $\phi$ is small, $\cos\phi$ is large
and $\sin\phi$ is small. We conclude that $\Delta x = -\ell \cos\phi$.

A typical application of this technique to force vectors is given in

 Using a protractor and a ruler, we make a careful scale drawing, as shown in figure \figref{eg-sd-vegas-graphical} on page \pageref{fig:eg-sd-vegas-graphical}.
 A scale of 1 cm$\leftrightarrow$10 \zu{km} was chosen for this solution.
With a ruler, we measure the

 With a protractor, we measure the angle $\theta$ to be 71\degunit.

Even when we don't intend to do an actual graphical calculation with a ruler and protractor, 
it can be convenient to diagram the addition of vectors in this way, as shown in figure \figref{tip-to-tail}. With $\Delta\vc{r}$
 vectors, it intuitively makes sense to lay the vectors tip-to-tail and draw the sum vector

to the land, and the maximum speed, $|\vc{v}_{BW}|$, of which the
boat is capable relative to the water.

\eganswer The boat's velocity relative to the land equals
the vector sum of its velocity with respect to the water and

If the boat is to travel straight across the river, i.e.,
along the $y$ axis, then we need to have $\vc{v}_{BL,x}=0$. This $x$
component equals the sum of the $x$ components of the other two vectors,
\begin{equation*}
            \vc{v}_BL,x  =  \vc{v}_BW,x +  \vc{v}_WL,x\eqquad,

        we get a valid mathematical operation, the multiplication of
        a vector by a scalar. Similarly, the second equation becomes
        \begin{equation*}
                \vc{r}_{cm} = \frac{\sum_j{ m_{j}\vc{r}_j}}{\sum_{j}{ m_j}}
\eqquad,
        \end{equation*}
        which is also valid. Each term in the sum on top contains a vector multiplied by a scalar,
        which gives a vector. Adding up all these vectors gives a vector, and dividing by the
        scalar sum on the bottom gives another vector.

This kind of wave-the-magic-wand-and-write-it-all-in-bold-face technique
will always give the right generalization from one dimension to three,
provided that the result makes sense mathematically --- if you find yourself
doing something nonsensical, such as adding a scalar to a vector, then
you haven't found the generalization correctly.\label{magicwand}

\begin{eg}{Colliding coins}
\egquestion Take two identical coins, put one down on a piece of paper, and slide
the other across the paper, shooting it fairly rapidly so that it hits the
target coin off-center. If you trace the initial and final positions of the
coins, you can determine the directions of their momentum vectors after the
collision. The angle between these vectors is always fairly close to, but a
little less than, 90 degrees. Why is this?

\eganswer Let the velocity vector of the incoming coin be $\vc{a}$, and let
the two outgoing velocity vectors be $\vc{b}$ and $\vc{c}$. Since the masses
are the same, conservation of momentum amounts to $\vc{a}=\vc{b}+\vc{c}$,
which means that it has to be possible to assemble the three vectors into
a triangle. If we assume that no energy is converted into heat and sound, then
conservation of energy gives (discarding the common factor of $m/2$)
$a^2=b^2+c^2$ for the magnitudes of the three vectors. This is the
Pythagorean theorem, which will hold only if the three vectors form a
right triangle.

The fact that we observe the angle to be somewhat less than 90 degrees shows
that the assumption used in the proof is only approximately valid: a little energy \emph{is}
converted into heat and sound. The opposite case would be a collision between
two blobs of putty, where the maximum possible amount of energy is converted
into heat and sound, the two blobs fly off together, giving an angle of
zero between their momentum vectors. The real-life experiment interpolates
between the ideal extremes of 0 and 90 degrees, but comes much closer to 90.

\begin{eg}{Pushing a block up a ramp}\label{eg:rampforces}
\egquestion
Figure \figref{rampforces}/1 shows a block being pushed up a
frictionless ramp at constant speed by an applied force $F_a$.
How much force is required, in terms of the block's mass, $m$,
and the angle of the ramp, $\theta$?

\eganswer
We analyzed this simple machine in example \ref{eg:inclinedplanework}
on page \pageref{eg:inclinedplanework} using the concept of work.
Here we'll do it using vector addition of forces.
Figure \figref{rampforces}/2 shows the other two forces acting on
the block: a normal force, $F_n$,  created by the ramp, and the
gravitational force, $F_g$. Because
the block is being pushed up at constant speed, it has zero
acceleration, and the total force on it must be zero. In
figure \figref{rampforces}/3, we position all the force vectors tip-to-tail
for addition. Since they have to add up to zero, they must join up without
leaving a gap, so they form a triangle. Using trigonometry we find
\begin{align*}
         F_{a}         &=  F_g\ \zu{sin}\:\theta \\
                &=  mg\ \zu{sin}\:\theta\eqquad.

\begin{eg}{Buoyancy, again}\label{eg:buoyancy}
\index{buoyancy}\index{Archimedes' principle}
In example \ref{eg:buoyancycube} on page \pageref{eg:buoyancycube}, we found that
the energy required to raise a cube immersed in a fluid is as if the
cube's mass had been reduced by an amount equal to the mass of the fluid
that otherwise would have been in the volume it occupies (Archimedes' principle).
From the energy perspective, this effect occurs because raising the cube allows
a certain amount of fluid to move downward, and the decreased gravitational
energy of the fluid tends to offset the increased gravitational energy of the cube. The proof
given there, however, could not easily be extended to other shapes.

<% marg(50) %>

  fig(
    'buoyancy2',

      Archimedes' principle works regardless of whether the
                      object is a cube. The fluid makes a force on every square millimeter of the object's
                      surface.
    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

Thinking in terms of force rather than energy, it becomes easier to give a proof
that works for any shape. A certain upward force is needed to support the object
in figure \figref{buoyancy2}. If this force was applied, then the object would be
in equilibrium: the vector sum of all the forces acting on it would be zero. These
forces are $\vc{F}_a$, the upward force just mentioned,
$\vc{F}_g$, the downward force of gravity,
and $\vc{F}_f$, the total force from the fluid:
\begin{equation*}
        \vc{F}_a+\vc{F}_{g}+\vc{F}_f = 0
\end{equation*}
Since the fluid is under more pressure at a greater
depth, the part of the fluid underneath the object tends to make more force than the
part above, so the fluid tends to help support the object.

Now suppose the object was removed, and instantly replaced with an equal volume
of fluid. The new fluid would be in equilibrium without any force applied to hold it up, so
\begin{equation*}
        \vc{F}_{gf}+\vc{F}_f = 0\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $\vc{F}_{gf}$, the weight of the fluid, is not the same as $\vc{F}_g$, the
weight of the object, but $\vc{F}_f$ is the same as before, since the pressure of
the surrounding fluid is the same as before at any particular depth. We therefore have
\begin{equation*}
        \vc{F}_a=-\left(\vc{F}_g-\vc{F}_{gf}\right)\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
which is Archimedes' principle in terms of force: the force required to support the
object is lessened by an amount equal to the weight of the fluid that would have occupied
its volume.
\end{eg}

By the way, the word ``pressure'' that I threw around casually in the preceding
example has a precise technical definition: force per unit area. The SI units of
pressure are $\nunit/\munit^2$, which can be abbreviated as pascals,
1 Pa = 1 $\nunit/\munit^2$. Atmospheric pressure is about 100 kPa.
By applying the equation $\vc{F}_{g}+\vc{F}_f = 0$ to the top and bottom
surfaces of a cubical volume of fluid, one can easily prove that the difference
in pressure between two different depths is $\Delta P=\rho g\Delta y$. (In physics,
``fluid'' can refer to either a gas or a liquid.)\index{fluid!defined}

\begin{eg}{A solar sail}\label{eg:solarsail}
        A solar sail\index{solar sail}, figure \figref{solarsail}/1, allows a spacecraft
        to get its thrust without using  internal stores of energy or having to carry along
        mass that it can shove out the back like a rocket. Sunlight strikes the sail
        and bounces off, transferring momentum to the sail.
        A working 30-meter-diameter solar sail, Cosmos 1, was built by
        an American company, and was supposed to be launched into
        orbit aboard
        a Russian booster launched from a submarine, but launch attempts in 2001 and
        2005 both failed.

    %q{An artist's rendering of what Cosmos 1 would have looked like in orbit.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

        In this example, we will calculate the optimal orientation of the sail, 
        assuming that ``optimal'' means changing the vehicle's energy as rapidly as possible.
        For simplicity, we model the complicated shape of the sail's surface as a disk,
        seen edge-on in figure \figref{solarsail}/2, and we assume that the craft is
        in a nearly circular orbit around the sun, hence the 90-degree angle between the
        direction of motion and the incoming sunlight. We assume that the sail is
        100\% reflective. The orientation
        of the sail is specified using the angle $\theta$ between the
        incoming rays of sunlight and the perpendicular to the sail. In other words,
        $\theta\zu{=0}$ if the sail is catching the sunlight full-on, while $\theta\zu{=90}\degunit$
        means that the sail is edge-on to the sun.

        Conservation of momentum gives
        \begin{align*}
                \vc{p}_{light,i} &= \vc{p}_{light,f}+\Delta\vc{p}_{sail}\eqquad, \\
        \intertext{where $\Delta\vc{p}_{sail}$ is the change in momentum picked up
                by the sail. Breaking this down into components, we have}
                0 &= p_{light,f,x}+\Delta p_{sail,x} \qquad \text{and} \\
                p_{light,i,y} &= p_{light,f,y}+\Delta p_{sail,y}\eqquad.
        \end{align*}
        As in example \ref{eg:yarkovsky} on page \pageref{eg:yarkovsky}, the component
        of the force that is directly away from the sun (up in figure \figref{solarsail}/2)
        doesn't change the energy of the craft, so we only care about
        $\Delta p_{sail,x}$, which equals $- p_{light,f,x}$. The outgoing
        light ray forms an angle of 2$\theta$ with the negative $y$ axis, or
        270$\degunit-2\theta$ measured counterclockwise from the $x$
        axis, so the useful thrust depends on $-\zu{cos}(270\degunit-2\theta)
        =\zu{sin}\:2\theta$.

        However, this is all assuming a given amount of light strikes the sail.
        During a certain time period, the amount of
        sunlight striking the sail depends on the cross-sectional area the sail presents
        to the sun, which is proportional to cos $\theta$. For $\theta\zu{=90}\degunit$,
        cos $\theta$ equals zero, since the sail is edge-on to the sun.  

                Putting together these two factors, the useful thrust is proportional to
                $\zu{sin}\ 2\theta\ \zu{cos}\:\theta$, and this quantity is maximized
                for $\theta\approx35\degunit$. A counterintuitive fact about this
                maneuver is that as the spacecraft spirals outward, its total energy
                (kinetic plus gravitational) increases, but its kinetic energy actually
                decreases!

\begin{eg}{A layback}\label{eg:layback}
The figure shows a rock climber 
using a technique called a layback. He can make the normal forces
$\vc{F}_{N1}$ and $\vc{F}_{N2}$ large, which has the side-effect of increasing
the frictional forces $\vc{F}_{F1}$ and $\vc{F}_{F2}$, so that he doesn't slip
down due to the gravitational (weight) force $\vc{F}_W$. The purpose of the
problem is not to analyze all of this in detail, but simply to practice
finding the components of the forces based on their magnitudes.
To keep the notation simple, let's write $F_{N1}$ for 
$|\vc{F}_{N1}|$, etc. The crack overhangs by a small, positive angle $\theta\approx9\degunit$.

In this example, we 
 determine the
$x$ component of $\vc{F}_{N1}$. The other nine components are left as an exercise to
the reader (problem \ref{hw:layback}, p.~\pageref{hw:layback}).

The easiest method is the one demonstrated in example \ref{eg:component-shortcut}
on p.~\pageref{eg:component-shortcut}. Casting vector $\vc{F}_{N1}$'s shadow on the ground,
we can tell that it would point to the left, so its $x$ component is
negative. The only two possibilities for its $x$ component are therefore
$-F_{N1}\cos\theta$ or $-F_{N1}\sin\theta$. We expect this force to have
a large $x$ component and a much smaller $y$. Since $\theta$ is small,
$\cos\theta\approx 1$, while $\sin\theta$ is small. Therefore
the $x$ component must be $-F_{N1}\cos\theta$.

In one dimension, we define the velocity as the derivative of the position
with respect to time, and we can think of the derivative as what we get
when we calculate $\Delta x/\Delta t$ for very short time intervals.
The quantity $\Delta x=x_f-x_i$ is calculated by subtraction.
In three dimensions, $x$ becomes \vc{r}, and the $\Delta\vc{r}$ vector
is calculated by \emph{vector} subtraction, $\Delta\vc{r}=\vc{r}_f-\vc{r}_i$.
Vector subtraction is defined component by component, so when we take
the derivative of a vector, this means we end up taking the derivative
component by component,
\begin{equation*}
        v_x =  \frac{\der x}{\der t} , \quad v_y =  \frac{\der y}{\der t}, \quad
        v_z =  \frac{\der z}{\der t} 
\end{equation*}
or
\begin{equation*}
        \frac{\der\vc{r}}{\der t} 
                = \frac{\der x}{\der t}\hat{\vc{x}}
                +\frac{\der y}{\der t}\hat{\vc{y}}+\frac{\der z}{\der t}\hat{\vc{z}}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
All of this reasoning applies equally well to any derivative of a vector, so for
instance we can take the second derivative,
\begin{equation*}
        a_x =  \frac{\der v_x}{\der t} , \quad 
        a_y =  \frac{\der v_y}{\der t} , \quad 
        a_z =  \frac{\der v_z}{\der t} 
\end{equation*}
or
\begin{equation*}
        \frac{\der\vc{v}}{\der t} 
                = \frac{\der v_x}{\der t}\hat{\vc{x}}+\frac{\der v_y}{\der t}\hat{\vc{y}}
                +\frac{\der v_z}{\der t}\hat{\vc{z}}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

A counterintuitive consequence of this is that the acceleration vector does not
need to be in the same direction as the motion. The velocity vector 
points in the direction of motion, but by Newton's second law,
$\vc{a}=\vc{F}/m$, the acceleration vector points in the same direction as the force,
not the motion. This is easiest to understand if we take velocity vectors
from two different moments in the motion, and visualize subtracting them
graphically to make a $\Delta\vc{v}$ vector.
The direction of the $\Delta\vc{v}$
vector tells us the direction of the acceleration vector as well, since
the derivative $\der\vc{v}/\der t$ can be approximated as $\Delta\vc{v}/\Delta t$.
As shown in figure \figref{deltav}/1, a change in the magnitude of the velocity vector implies
an acceleration that is in the direction of motion. A change in the direction
of the velocity vector produces an acceleration perpendicular to the motion,  \figref{deltav}/2.

where $\omega$ is the number of radians traveled per second, and the positive or negative

What is its acceleration?

The components of the velocity are

         v_{y}        &= \ \ \ \omega r\ \zu{cos}\ \omega t\eqquad,
\end{align*} 
and for the acceleration we have
\begin{align*}
         a_{x}        &= -\omega^2 r\ \zu{cos}\ \omega t \qquad \text{and}\\
         a_{y}        &= -\omega^2 r\ \zu{sin}\ \omega t\eqquad.
\end{align*} 
The acceleration vector has cosines and sines in the same places as the
\vc{r} vector, but with minus signs in front, so it points in the opposite direction,
i.e., toward the center of the circle. By Newton's second law, \vc{a}=\vc{F}/$m$,
this shows that the force must be inward as well; without this force, the object
would fly off straight.

      that the direction of the force and acceleration in circular motion is inward.
      The heptagon, 2, is a better approximation to a circle than the
              triangle, 1. To make an infinitely good approximation to circular motion,
              we would need to use an infinitely large number of infinitesimal taps, which
              would amount to a steady inward force.

The magnitude of the acceleration is
\begin{align*}
        |\vc{a}|        &= \sqrt{ a_x^2+ a_{y}^2}\\
                        &= \omega^2 r\eqquad.
\end{align*}
It makes sense that $\omega$ is squared, since reversing the sign of $\omega$
corresponds to reversing the direction of motion, but the acceleration is toward the
center of the circle, regardless of whether the motion is clockwise or counterclockwise.
This result can also be rewritten in the form
\begin{equation*}
        |\vc{a}|        = \frac{|\vc{v}|^2}{r}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
\end{eg}

Although I've relegated the results $a=\omega^2 r=|\vc{v}|^2/r$ to an example because they are a straightforward corollary
of more general principles already developed, they are important and useful enough to record for later use.
\index{circular motion!inward force}
\index{circular motion!no forward force}
These results are
counterintuitive as well. Until Newton, physicists and laypeople alike had assumed
that the planets would need a force to push them \emph{forward} in their orbits.
Figure \figref{hammer} may help to make it more plausible that only an inward force
is required. A forward force might be needed in order to cancel out a backward
force such as friction, \figref{carcircleforces}, but the total force in the forward-backward
direction needs to be exactly zero for constant-speed motion.
\index{circular motion!no outward force}
When you are in a car undergoing circular motion, there is also a strong illusion of an
\emph{outward} force. But what object could be making such a force? The car's seat
makes an inward force on you, not an outward one. There is no object that could be
exerting an outward force on your body. In reality, this force is an illusion that comes
from our brain's intuitive efforts to interpret the situation within a noninertial frame of
reference. As shown in figure \figref{truckcircular}, we can describe everything perfectly
well in an inertial frame of reference, such as the frame attached to the sidewalk.
In such a frame, the bowling ball goes straight because there is \emph{no} force
on it. The wall of the truck's bed hits the ball, not the other way around.

An integral is really just a sum of many infinitesimally small terms. Since vector
addition is defined in terms of addition of the components, an integral of a vector
quantity is  found by doing integrals component by component.

\begin{eg}{Projectile motion}
\egquestion
Find the motion of an object whose acceleration vector is constant, for instance
a projectile moving under the influence of gravity.

\eganswer
We integrate the acceleration to get the velocity, and then integrate the velocity to
get the position as a function of time. Doing this to the $x$ component of the
acceleration, we find
\begin{align*}
         x         &= \int{\left(\int{a_x\ \zu{d}t}\right)\ \zu{d}t} \\
                        &= \int{\left(a_xt+v_{x\zu{o}}\right)\zu{d}t}\eqquad,\\
\intertext{where $v_{ x\zu{o}}$ is a constant of integration, and}
        x        &= \frac{1}{2}a_xt^2
                                        + v_{x\zu{o}}t + x_\zu{o}\eqquad.
\end{align*}
Similarly, $y\zu{=(1/2)} a_{y} t^2+  v_{ y\zu{o}} t +  y_\zu{o}$
and $z=\zu{(1/2)} a_{z} t^2+  v_{ z\zu{o}} t +  z_\zu{o}$.
Once one has gained a little confidence, it becomes natural to do the whole thing
as a single vector integral,
\begin{align*}
        \vc{r}        &= \int{\left(\int{\vc{a}\ \zu{d} t}\right)\ \zu{d} t} \\
                        &= \int{\left(\vc{a} t+\vc{v}_\zu{o}\right)\zu{d} t} \\
                &= \frac{1}{2}\vc{a} t^2+\vc{v}_\zu{o} t+\vc{r}_\zu{o}\eqquad,
\end{align*}
where now the constants of integration are vectors.

How would we generalize the mechanical work
equation $\der E=F \der x$ to three dimensions?
Energy is a scalar, but force and distance are vectors, so it might
seem at first that the kind of ``magic-wand'' generalization discussed
on page \pageref{magicwand} failed here, since we don't know of any way
to multiply two vectors together to get a scalar. Actually, this is Nature giving
us a hint that there is such a multiplication operation waiting for us to invent it,
and since Nature is simple, we can be assured that this
operation will work just fine in any situation where a similar generalization is
required.  

How should this operation be defined? Let's consider what we would get
by performing this operation on various combinations of the unit vectors
$\hat{\vc{x}}$, $\hat{\vc{y}}$, and $\hat{\vc{z}}$. The conventional notation
for the operation is to put a dot, $\cdot$, between the two vectors, and the
operation is therefore called
the \emph{dot product}.\index{dot product}\index{vector!dot product}
Rotational invariance requires that we handle the three coordinate axes
in the same way, without giving special treatment to any of them, so we must
have $\hat{\vc{x}}\cdot\hat{\vc{x}}=\hat{\vc{y}}\cdot\hat{\vc{y}}=\hat{\vc{z}}\cdot\hat{\vc{z}}$
and $\hat{\vc{x}}\cdot\hat{\vc{y}}=\hat{\vc{y}}\cdot\hat{\vc{z}}=\hat{\vc{z}}\cdot\hat{\vc{x}}$.
This is supposed to be a way of generalizing ordinary multiplication, so for consistency
with the property $1\times1=1$ of ordinary numbers, the result
of multiplying a magnitude-one vector by itself had better be the scalar 1, so
$\hat{\vc{x}}\cdot\hat{\vc{x}}=\hat{\vc{y}}\cdot\hat{\vc{y}}=\hat{\vc{z}}\cdot\hat{\vc{z}}=1$.
Furthermore, there is no way to satisfy rotational invariance unless we define the mixed
products to be zero,
$\hat{\vc{x}}\cdot\hat{\vc{y}}=\hat{\vc{y}}\cdot\hat{\vc{z}}=\hat{\vc{z}}\cdot\hat{\vc{x}}=0$;
for example, a 90-degree rotation of our frame of reference about the $z$ axis
reverses the sign of $\hat{\vc{x}}\cdot\hat{\vc{y}}$, but rotational invariance requires
that $\hat{\vc{x}}\cdot\hat{\vc{y}}$ produce the same result either way, and zero is the
only number that stays the same when we reverse its sign. Establishing these six
products of unit vectors suffices to define the operation in general, since any
two vectors that we want to multiply can be broken down into components, e.g.,
$(2\hat{\vc{x}}+3\hat{\vc{z}})\cdot\hat{\vc{z}}
=2\hat{\vc{x}}\cdot\hat{\vc{z}}+3\hat{\vc{z}}\cdot\hat{\vc{z}}=0+3=3$. Thus by
requiring rotational invariance and consistency with multiplication of ordinary
numbers, we find that there is only one possible way to define a multiplication
operation on two vectors that gives a scalar as the result.\footnote{There is, however,
a different operation, discussed in the next chapter, which multiplies two vectors
to give a vector.} The dot product has all of the properties we normally associate with
multiplication, except that there is no ``dot division.''

\begin{eg}{Dot product in terms of components}
If we know the components of any two vectors \vc{b} and \vc{c}, we can find
their dot product:
\begin{align*}        
        \vc{b}\cdot\vc{c}        &= 
        \left( b_{x}\hat{\vc{x}}+ b_{y}\hat{\vc{y}}+ b_z\hat{\vc{z}}\right)
        \cdot
        \left( c_{x}\hat{\vc{x}}+ c_{y}\hat{\vc{y}}+ c_z\hat{\vc{z}}\right) \\
                &=  b_x c_x+ b_y c_y+ b_z c_z\eqquad.
\end{align*}
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Magnitude expressed with a dot product}\label{eg:magnitudedot}
If we take the dot product of any vector \vc{b} with itself, we find
\begin{align*}        
        \vc{b}\cdot\vc{b}        &= 
        \left( b_{x}\hat{\vc{x}}+ b_{y}\hat{\vc{y}}+ b_z\hat{\vc{z}}\right)
        \cdot
        \left( b_{x}\hat{\vc{x}}+ b_{y}\hat{\vc{y}}+ b_z\hat{\vc{z}}\right) \\
                &=  b_{x}^2+ b_{y}^2+ b_z^2\eqquad,\\
\intertext{so its magnitude can be expressed as}
        |\vc{b}| &= \sqrt{\vc{b}\cdot\vc{b}}\eqquad.
\end{align*}
We will often write $b^2$ to mean $\vc{b}\cdot\vc{b}$, when the context makes it
clear what is intended. For example, we could express kinetic energy as
$\zu{(1/2)} m|\vc{v}|^2$, $\zu{(1/2)} m\vc{v}\cdot\vc{v}$,
or $\zu{(1/2)} m v^2$. In the third version, nothing but context tells
us that $v$ really stands for the magnitude of some vector $\vc{v}$.

\begin{eg}{Geometric interpretation}\label{eg:dot-product-interp}
In figure \figref{dotgeom}, vectors \vc{a}, \vc{b}, and \vc{c} represent the sides of a triangle,
and $\vc{a}=\vc{b}+\vc{c}$. The law of cosines gives
\begin{equation*}
        |\vc{c}|^2 = |\vc{a}|^2+|\vc{b}|^2-2|\vc{a}||\vc{b}|\ \zu{cos}\ \theta\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Using the result of example \ref{eg:magnitudedot}, we can also write this as
\begin{align*}
        |\vc{c}|^2        &= \vc{c}\cdot\vc{c} \\
                                &= (\vc{a}-\vc{b})\cdot(\vc{a}-\vc{b}) \\
                                &= \vc{a}\cdot\vc{a}+\vc{b}\cdot\vc{b}-2\vc{a}\cdot\vc{b}\eqquad.
\end{align*}
Matching up terms in these two expressions, we find
\begin{equation*}
        \vc{a}\cdot\vc{b} = |\vc{a}||\vc{b}|\ \zu{cos}\ \theta\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
which is a geometric interpretation for the dot product.         \end{eg}

The result of example \ref{eg:dot-product-interp} is very useful.
It gives us a way to find the angle between two
vectors if we know their components. It can be used to show that the dot product
of any two perpendicular vectors is zero.
It also leads to a nifty
proof that the dot product is rotationally invariant --- up until now I've only
proved that if a rotationally invariant product exists, the dot product is it ---
because angles and lengths aren't affected by a rotation, so the right side of the
equation is rotationally invariant, and therefore so is the left side.

work within its own body, but is not doing work on the pack.

\label{separatepconsproof}
A good application of the dot product is to allow us to write a simple, streamlined
proof of separate conservation of the momentum components. (You can skip the
proof without losing the continuity of the text.) The argument is
a generalization of the one-dimensional proof on page \pageref{pconsproof1d},
and makes the same assumption about the type of system of particles we're
dealing with. The kinetic energy of one of the particles
is $(1/2)m\vc{v}\cdot\vc{v}$, and when we
transform into a different frame of reference moving with velocity \vc{u} relative
to the original frame, the one-dimensional rule $v\rightarrow v+u$ turns into
vector addition, $\vc{v}\rightarrow \vc{v}+\vc{u}$. In the new frame of reference,
the kinetic energy is $(1/2)m(\vc{v}+\vc{u})\cdot(\vc{v}+\vc{u})$. For a system
of $n$ particles, we have
\begin{align*}
        K        &= \sum_{j=1}^{n}{\frac{1}{2}m_j(\vc{v}_j+\vc{u})\cdot(\vc{v}_j+\vc{u})} \\
                &= \frac{1}{2}\left[\sum_{j=1}^{n}{m_j\vc{v}_j\cdot\vc{v}_j}
                                +2\sum_{j=1}^{n}{m_j\vc{v}_j\cdot\vc{u}}
                                +\sum_{j=1}^{n}{m_j\vc{u}\cdot\vc{u}}\right]\eqquad.
\end{align*}
As in the proof on page \pageref{pconsproof1d}, the first sum is simply the
total kinetic energy in the original frame of reference, and the last sum is
a constant, which has no effect
on the validity of the conservation law. The middle sum can be rewritten as
\begin{align*}
        2\sum_{j=1}^{n}{m_j\vc{v}_j\cdot\vc{u}}
                &= 2\ \vc{u}\cdot\sum_{j=1}^{n}{m_j\vc{v}_j}\\
                &= 2\ \vc{u}\cdot\sum_{j=1}^{n}{\vc{p}_j}\eqquad,
\end{align*}
so the only way energy can be conserved for all values of \vc{u} is
if the vector sum of the momenta is conserved as well.

    %q{An object moves through a field of force.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

In physics we often deal with fields of force, meaning situations where the force
on an object depends on its position. For instance, figure \figref{sea-of-arrows-wind}
could represent a map of the trade winds affecting a sailing ship, or a chart of
the gravitational forces experienced by a space probe entering a double-star
system. An object moving under the influence of this force will not necessarily
be moving in the same direction as the force at every moment. The sailing
ship can tack against the wind, due to the force from the water on the keel.
The space probe, if it entered from the top of the diagram at high speed,
would start to curve around to the right, but its inertia would carry it forward, and
it wouldn't instantly swerve to match the direction of the gravitational force.
For convenience, we've defined the gravitational field, \vc{g}, as the force
\emph{per unit mass}, but that trick only leads to a simplification because the
gravitational force on an object is proportional to its mass. Since this subsection
is meant to apply to any kind of force, we'll discuss everything in terms of the
actual force vector, \vc{F}, in units of newtons.

If an object moves through the field of force along some curved path from point $\vc{r}_1$
to point $\vc{r}_2$,
the force will do a certain amount of work on
it. To calculate this work, we can 
break the path up into infinitesimally short segments,
find the work done along each segment, and add them all up.
For an object traveling along a nice straight $x$ axis, we use the symbol
$\der x$ to indicate the length of any infinitesimally short segment.
In three dimensions, moving along a curve, each segment is
a tiny vector $\der\vc{r}=\hat{\vc{x}}\der x+\hat{\vc{y}}\der y+\hat{\vc{z}}\der z$.
The work theorem can be expressed as a dot product, so the work done
along a segment is $\vc{F}\cdot\der\vc{r}$. We want to integrate this, but
we don't know how to integrate with respect to a variable that's a vector,
so let's define a variable $s$ that indicates the distance traveled so far along
the curve, and integrate with respect to it instead. The expression
$\vc{F}\cdot\der\vc{r}$ can be rewritten as $|\vc{F}|\:|\der\vc{r}|\:\cos\theta$,
where $\theta$ is the angle between \vc{F} and $\der\vc{r}$. But
$|\der\vc{r}|$ is simply $\der s$, so the amount of work done becomes
\begin{equation*}
        \Delta E = \int_{\vc{r}_1}^{\vc{r}_2}{|\vc{F}| \cos\theta}\ \der s\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Both \vc{F} and $\theta$ are functions of $s$.
As a matter of notation, it's cumbersome to have to write the integral like this.
Vector notation was designed to eliminate this kind of drudgery. We therefore
define the line integral\index{line integral}
\begin{align*}
        \int_C{\vc{F}\cdot\der\vc{r}}
\end{align*}
as a way of notating this type of integral. The `C' refers to the curve along which
the object travels. If we don't know this curve then we typically can't evaluate
the line integral just by knowing the initial and final positions $\vc{r}_1$ and $\vc{r}_2$.

The basic idea of calculus is that integration undoes differentiation, and
vice-versa. In one dimension, we could describe an interaction either in terms of
a force or in terms of an interaction energy. 
We could integrate force with respect to position
 to find minus the energy, or
we could find the force by taking minus the derivative of the energy. In the line
integral, position is represented by a vector. What would it mean to take a derivative
with respect to a vector? The correct way to generalize the derivative
$\der U/\der x$ to three dimensions is to replace it with the following vector,
\begin{equation*}
        \frac{\der U}{\der x}\hat{\vc{x}}
        +\frac{\der U}{\der y}\hat{\vc{y}}
        +\frac{\der U}{\der z}\hat{\vc{z}}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
called the \emph{gradient}\index{gradient} of $U$, and written with an upside-down
delta\footnote{The symbol $\nabla$ is called a ``nabla.'' Cool word!}
 like this, $\nabla U$.
Each of these three derivatives is really what's known as a
partial derivative.\index{derivative!partial}\index{partial derivative}\label{partial-der} What that means
is that when you're differentiating $U$ with respect to $x$, you're supposed to treat
$y$ and $z$ and constants, and similarly when you do the other two derivatives.
To emphasize that a derivative is a partial derivative, it's customary to write it using
the symbol $\partial$ in place of the differential d's. Putting all this notation together, we have
\begin{equation*}
        \nabla U = \frac{\partial U}{\partial x}\hat{\vc{x}}
        +\frac{\partial U}{\partial y}\hat{\vc{y}}
        +\frac{\partial U}{\partial z}\hat{\vc{z}} \qquad \text{[definition of the gradient]}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
The gradient looks scary, but it has a very simple physical interpretation. It's a vector
that points in the direction in which $U$ is increasing most rapidly, and it tells you
how rapidly $U$ is increasing in that direction. For instance, sperm cells in plants
and animals find the egg cells by traveling in the direction of the gradient of the
concentration of certain hormones. When they reach the location 
of the strongest hormone concentration, they find their destiny. In terms of the
gradient, the force corresponding to a given interaction energy is
$\vc{F}=-\nabla U$.

\begin{eg}{Force exerted by a spring}
In one dimension, Hooke's law is $U=\zu{(1/2)} kx^2$.
Suppose we tether one end of a spring to a post, but it's free to stretch and
swing around in a plane. Let's say its equilibrium length is zero, and let's
choose the origin of our coordinate system to be at the post.
Rotational invariance requires that its energy only depend on the magnitude
of the \vc{r} vector, not its direction, so in two dimensions we have
$U=\zu{(1/2)} k|\vc{r}|^2
        =\zu{(1/2)} k\left( x^2+ y^2\right)$.
The force exerted by the spring is then

\extitle{A}{Force and Motion}

Equipment:

\begin{indentedblock}
    2-meter pieces of butcher paper

    wood blocks with hooks

    string

    masses to put on top of the blocks to increase friction

    spring scales (preferably calibrated in Newtons)
\end{indentedblock}

Suppose a person pushes a crate, sliding it across the floor
at a certain speed, and then repeats the same thing but at a
higher speed. This is essentially the situation you will act
out in this exercise. What do you think is different about
her force on the crate in the two situations? Discuss this
with your group and write down your hypothesis:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. First you will measure the amount of friction between the
wood block and the butcher paper when the wood and paper
surfaces are slipping over each other. The idea is to attach
a spring scale to the block and then slide the butcher paper
under the block while using the scale to keep the block from
moving with it. Depending on the amount of force your spring
scale was designed to measure, you may need to put an extra
mass on top of the block in order to increase the amount of
friction. It is a good idea to use long piece of string to
attach the block to the spring scale, since otherwise one
tends to pull at an angle instead of directly horizontally.

First measure the amount of friction force when sliding the
butcher paper as slowly as possible:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now measure the amount of friction force at a significantly
higher speed, say 1 meter per second. (If you try to go too
fast, the motion is jerky, and it is impossible to get an
accurate reading.) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Discuss your results. Why are we justified in assuming that
the string's force on the block (i.e., the scale reading) is
the same amount as the paper's frictional force on the block?

2. Now try the same thing but with the block moving and the
paper standing still. Try two different speeds.

Do your results agree with your original hypothesis? If not,
discuss what's going on. How does the block ``know'' how fast to go?

\noindent Place the cart on the air track and attach springs so that it can vibrate.

1. Test whether the period of vibration depends on amplitude. Try at
least two moderate amplitudes, for which the springs do not go slack,
and at least one amplitude that is large enough so that they do go
slack.

2. Try a cart with a different mass. Does the period change by the
expected factor, based on the equation $T=2\pi\sqrt{m/k}$?

3. Use a spring scale to pull the cart away from equilibrium, and
make a graph of force versus position. Is it linear? If so, what is
its slope?

4. Test the equation $T=2\pi\sqrt{m/k}$ numerically.

Exercise D is on the following two pages.

\pagebreak

\extitle{D}{Vectors and Motion}

Each diagram on page \pageref{fig:ex-knightish} shows the motion of an object in
an $x-y$ plane. Each dot is one location of the object at
one moment in time. The time interval from one dot to the
next is always the same, so you can think of the vector that
connects one dot to the next as a $\vc{v}$ vector, and subtract
to find $\Delta\vc{v}$ vectors.

1. Suppose the object in diagram 1 is moving from the top
left to the bottom right. Deduce whatever you can about the
force acting on it. Does the force always have the same
magnitude? The same direction?

Invent a physical situation that this diagram could represent.

What if you reinterpret the diagram, and reverse the
object's direction of motion?

2. What can you deduce about the force that is acting in diagram 2?

Invent a physical situation that diagram 2 could represent.

3. What can you deduce about the force that is acting in diagram 3?

Invent a physical situation.
