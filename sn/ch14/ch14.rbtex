In 1921, Otto Stern proposed an experiment about angular momentum, shown in figure \figref{stern-gerlach}
on p.~\pageref{fig:stern-gerlach}, that his
boss at the University of Frankfurt
and many of his colleagues were certain wouldn't work. At this time, quantization of
angular momentum had been proposed by Niels Bohr, but most physicists, if they had heard of
it at all, thought of the idea as a philosophical metaphor or a mathematical trick that
just happened to give correct results. World War I was over, hyperinflation was getting
under way in Germany (a paper mark was worth a few percent of its prewar value), and
the Nazi coup was still in the future, so that Stern, a Jew, had not yet been forced to flee to America.
Because of the difficult economic situation, Stern and his colleague Walther Gerlach scraped
up some of the funds to carry out the experiment from US banker Henry Goldman, cofounder of the
investment house Goldman-Sachs.

The entire apparatus was sealed inside a vacuum chamber with the best vacuum obtainable
at the time. A sample of silver was heated to $1000\degcunit$, evaporating it.
The atoms leaving the oven encountered two narrow slits, so that what emerged was a beam with
a width of only $0.03\ \zu{mm}$, or about a third of the width of a human hair. The atoms then
encountered a magnetic field. Because the atoms were electrically neutral, we would normally
expect them to be unaffected by a magnetic field. But in the planetary model of the atom, we
imagine the electrons as orbiting in circles like little current loops, which would give
the atom a magnetic dipole moment $\vc{m}$. Even if we are sophisticated enough about quantum mechanics not to
believe in the circular orbits, it is reasonable to imagine that such a dipole moment would exist.
When a dipole encounters a \emph{nonuniform}
field, it experiences a force
(example \ref{eg:dipole-in-nonuniform-field-fancy}, p.~\pageref{eg:dipole-in-nonuniform-field-fancy}).
In this example, the forces in the $x$ and $z$ directions would be
$F_x=\vc{m}\cdot(\partial\vc{B}/\partial x)$
and $F_z=\vc{m}\cdot(\partial\vc{B}/\partial z)$. (Because of Gauss's law for magnetism,
these two derivatives are not independent --- 
we have $\partial B_x/\partial x+\partial B_z/\partial z=0$.) 
The rapidly varying magnetic field for this experiment
was provided by a pair of specially shaped magnet poles, described in
example \ref{eg:sharp-magnet-poles}, p.~\pageref{eg:sharp-magnet-poles}.

Because electrons have charge, we expect the motion of an electron to give it a magnetic dipole moment $\vc{m}$.
But they also have mass, so for exactly the same reasons, we expect there to be some angular momentum $\vc{L}$ as well.
The analogy is in fact mathematically exact, as discussed in sec.~\ref{subsec:g-factor}, p.~\pageref{subsec:g-factor}.
Therefore this experiment with dipoles and magnetic fields is actually
a probe of the behavior of angular momentum at the atomic level.

Luckily for Stern and Gerlach, who had no modern knowledge of atomic structure, the silver atoms that
they chose to use do happen
to have nonzero total $\vc{L}$, and therefore nonzero $\vc{m}$.
The atoms come out of the oven with random orientations. 

Classically, we would expect the following.
Each atom has an energy $\vc{m}\cdot\vc{B}$ due to its interaction with the magnetic field, and
this energy is conserved, so that the component $m_x$ stays constant. However, there is a
torque $\vc{m}\times\vc{B}$, and this causes the direction of the atom's angular momentum to
precess, i.e., wobble like a top, with its angular momentum forming a cone centered on the $x$ axis
(example \ref{eg:precession}, p.~\pageref{eg:precession}). This precession is extremely fast, carrying
out about $10^{10}$ wobbles per second, so that the atom precesses about $10^6$ times while traveling the
3.5 cm length of the spectrometer. So even though the forces $F_x$ and $F_z$ are typically about
the same size, the rapid precession causes $F_z$ to average out to nearly zero, and only a deflection
in the $x$ direction is expected. Because the orientations of the atoms are random as they enter the
magnetic field, they will have every possible value of $L_x$ ranging from $-|\vc{L}|$
to $+|\vc{L}|$, and therefore we expect that when the magnetic field is turned on, the effect should
be to smear out the image on the glass plate from a vertical line to a somewhat wider oval. The atoms
are dispersed from left to right along a certain scale of measurement according to their random
value of $L_x$. The spectrometer is a device for determining $L_x$,
a continuously varying number.

But that's all the classical theory. Quantum mechanically, $L_x$ is
quantized, so that only certain very specific values of $F_x$ can
occur. Although the discussion of precession above is really classical
rather than quantum-mechanical, the result of $F_z$ averaging out to
zero turns out to be approximately right if the field is strong.
Therefore we expect to see well separated vertical bands on the glass
plate corresponding to the quantized values of $L_x$.  This is
approximately what is seen in figure \figref{stern-gerlach},
although the field rapidly weakens outside the $x$-$y$ plane, so we get the slightly
more complicated pattern like a sideways lipstick kiss. Since we
observe two values of $L_x$ (the two ``lips''), we conclude from these
results that a silver atom has spin $1/2$, so that $L_x$ takes on the
values $-\hbar/2$ and $+\hbar/2$. Although it took about five years for
the experiment to be interpreted completely correctly, we now understand
the Stern-Gerlach experiment to be not just a confirmation of the quantization
of angular momentum along any given axis but also the first experimental
evidence that the electron has an intrinsic spin of 1/2.

\startdqs

\begin{dq}
Could the Stern-Gerlach experiment be carried out with a beam of electrons?
\end{dq}

\begin{dq}
A few weeks after the Stern-Gerlach experiment's results became
public, Einstein and Ehrenfest carried out the following reasoning,
which seemed to them to make the results inexplicable.
Before a particular silver atom enters the magnetic
field, its magnetic moment $\vc{m}$ is randomly oriented. Once it
enters the magnetic field, it has an energy $\vc{m}\cdot\vc{B}$.
Unless there is a mechanism for the transfer of energy in or out of
the atom, this energy can't change, and therefore the magnetic moment
can only precess about the $\vc{B}$ vector, but the angle between
$\vc{m}$ and $\vc{B}$ must remain the same. Therefore the atom cannot
align itself with the field. (They considered various mechanisms of
energy loss, such as collisions and radiation, and concluded that all
of them were too slow by orders of magnitude to have an effect during
the atom's time of flight.) It seemed to them that as soon as the atom left
the oven, it was somehow required
to have anticipated the direction of the field and picked one of two orientations
with respect to it. How can this paradox be resolved?
\end{dq}

\begin{dq}\label{dq:stern-gerlach-twice-qualitative}
Suppose we send a beam of oxygen molecules, with $L=\hbar$, through a Stern-Gerlach spectrometer,
throwing away the emerging parts with $\ell_x=-1$ and $+1$ to make a beam of the pure $\ell_x=0$ state.
Now we let this beam pass through a second spectrometer that is identical
but oriented along the $z$ axis. Can we produce a beam in which
every molecule has both $\ell_x=0$ and $\ell_z=+1$? 
Hint: See the example in fig.~\figref{completeness-ylm}, p.~\pageref{completeness-ylm}.

Figure \figref{n2-spectrum} shows the visible-light spectrum of the molecule $\zu{N}_2$.
Because this particular chemical bond is unusually strong, the molecule does not break apart, even at the high
temperature of a gas discharge tube, so we see the spectrum of the molecule, not of monoatomic nitrogen.
This spectrum is more complex than the spectrum of the hydrogen atom, and that's not surprising,
because the number of different states grows exponentially with the number of particles (here, 14 electrons
plus 2 nuclei).

What is more surprising is that there are some clear, simple patterns in this spectrum --- patterns
simpler than any that we would see in the spectrum of a monoatomic gas with the same number of particles.
To start to understand this, we note that $\zu{N}_2$ lacks the spherical symmetry of an individual
atom, but it does have an axis of symmetry, \subfigref{axial-symmetry}{1}. These properties are also possessed
by many nuclei, e.g., \subfigref{axial-symmetry}{2}. We now consider three different ways in which an excited
energy state could occur in $\zu{N}_2$:

\begin{itemize}
\item Individual \emph{particles} (electrons) can be raised to a higher energy level.
\item The molecule can \emph{vibrate} along its long axis, so that the nuclei (which have nearly all the inertia)
       move back and forth, elongating and compressing the system.
\item The molecule can \emph{rotate}.

Particle excitations would produce the type of very complex, disorganized spectrum that we normally see in atoms
that have many electrons, so that isn't what we're seeing in figure \figref{n2-spectrum}. What about vibrations?
For a classical harmonic oscillator, we know that the frequency of vibration is independent of the amplitude.
If a classical oscillator contains electric charge, it will emit electromagnetic radiation at this frequency,
smoothly and continuously draining itself of energy. As the energy is lost, the frequency stays the same. 
By the correspondence principle, we expect that when the quantum mechanical version of such a system is highly
excited, it should emit a large number of photons of this frequency $f$, so that the discrete quantum jumps
are undetectable and the radiation appears as a classical wave. We can thus infer that for a quantum vibrator,
the excited states should show an \emph{evenly spaced} ladder of energy levels.

Figure \figref{n2-level-scheme} shows how the series of red lines in figure \figref{n2-spectrum} arises.
For an excitation consisting only of vibrational motion, we
expect based on the correspondence principle to see the evenly spaced ladder of states shown in a stack
built above the ground state, with all of the photons having the same energy. These states and transitions
do exist, but the light lies in the infrared spectrum and so is not seen in figure \figref{n2-spectrum}.
The red visible-light lines arise as shown in the second box, from states that involve both a certain
particle excitation and some vibration. Because the spacing of the two ladders is slightly unequal, the
red lines all have slightly different wavelengths.

<% begin_sec("Rotation",nil,'qm-rotation') %>

What about rotation? An interesting thing happens here due to the structure of quantum mechanics. Quantum
mechanics can describe motion only as a wave, with the value of the wave oscillating from one place to another.
But this implies that according to quantum mechanics, no object can rotate about one
of its axes of symmetry, for the rotated version of a state would then be the same state.
This is why rotational excitations are never seen in individual atoms, or in nuclei
that have spherical shapes. In examples like the ones in figure \figref{axial-symmetry}, which have a single
axis of symmetry, we can therefore have end-over-end rotation, but never rotation about the symmetry axis.
Such end-over-end rotational states are observed in $\zu{N}_2$, for example, but because this involves
large motions by the high-mass nuclei, the moment of inertia $I$ is quite large, and therefore the rotational
energies --- classically, $K=L^2/2I$ --- are very small, and infrared rather than visible photons are emitted.
If rotation about the symmetry axis were possible, then the moment of inertia would be thousands of times smaller,
because in such a rotation the nuclei would not move. The energies involved would be thousands of times higher,
and the photons would lie approximately in the visible region of the spectrum. No such visible lines are actually observed.

  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

Perhaps more vivid evidence for the nonexistence of rotation about a symmetry axis is shown in figure
\figref{hf-rotation}. The states involving end-over-end rotation of the nucleus as a whole (``collective'' rotation)
are approximately a parabola on this graph, which is reasonable given the classical relation $K=L^2/2I$.
But angular momentum cannot be generated along the symmetry axis through collective rotation. Instead,
we see an irregular set of energy levels in which first one particle (for $L\le8\hbar$) and then two
(14 and $16\hbar$) are excited.

Note that only even multiples of $\hbar$ are observed in collective rotation in figure \figref{hf-rotation}.
This is because the nucleus's shape has an additional mirror symmetry, so that it is unaffected by
a 180-degree rotation. This means that the wavefunction describing the collective rotation
must oscillate twice as we pass through a full rotation.

<% begin_sec("Corrections to semiclassical energies",nil,'qm-corrections') %>

So far we've been using the correspondence principle to make educated guesses about quantum-mechanical
expressions for the energies of vibrators and rotors. This style of reasoning is called semiclassical,
because it combines ideas from classical and quantum physics. These expressions are guaranteed to be good approximations 
in the classical limit obtained when
the quantum numbers are large, but figure \figref{rot-and-vib-corrections} shows that the approximations
can be poorer when the quantum numbers are small.

In the case of the $n$th excited state of a vibrator, the energy is $(n+1/2)\hbar\omega$, where the $+1/2$ term represents
a quantum correction to the semiclassical approximation. This shifts the entire ladder upward in energy by half
a step. In particular, the energy of the ground state is not zero but rather $(1/2)\hbar\omega$. This can be verified
quantitatively by calculating the energy for the solution to the Schr\"odinger discussed using the guess-and-check method
in problem \ref{hw:quantumho}, p.~\pageref{hw:quantumho}. It is easy to see why the answer cannot be zero, for
if it were, then the particle in the ground state would have zero kinetic energy and zero potential energy.
To have zero kinetic energy, it would have to have a momentum of exactly zero, so $\Delta p=0$, but to have
zero potential energy it would also have to sit still at exactly the equilibrium position, so $\Delta x=0$. But
this would violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and so is impossible.

The inevitable motion that
is present even in the ground state is known as zero-point motion,\index{zero-point motion}\label{zpm}
and its energy is the zero-point energy.
Relativity tells us that $E=mc^2$, so the zero-point energy of particles is equivalent to a certain amount of
mass. In fact, nearly all the mass of ordinary matter arises from the zero-point energy of the quarks inside
the neutrons and protons. Another interesting application is to spontaneous nuclear fission, which is the basis
for nuclear energy, providing the kick-off for a chain reaction. Spontaneous fission requires that a
nucleus become more and more elongated until it breaks apart into two pieces. The very elongated shapes have
a high potential energy, so that spontaneous fission requires quantum-mechanical tunneling. If it were not for
the zero-point vibrational energy associated with this motion, the tunneling probability for uranium and
plutonium isotopes would be extremely small. These isotopes would decay only by alpha emission, and nuclear
reactors and bombs would not work.

Figure \figref{j-jplus1-visual} shows visually the reason for the correction of $\ell^2$ to $\ell(\ell+1)$.
Each of these standing waves has $|\ell_z|=16$, where $z$ is the vertical
axis. But only \subfigref{j-jplus1-visual}{2} is a solution of the Schr\"odinger equation for a state of definite
$\ell$.
To be a solution of the Schr\"odinger equation, such a wave must have the same kinetic energy everywhere. 
Each of these three has the same kinetic energy associated
with its wavelength in the ``east-west,'' or azimuthal, direction.
Wave
\subfigref{j-jplus1-visual}{1} is not a solution, because near the equator, it has an extremely short wavelength
in the ``north-south,'' or longitudinal, direction, and this gives it a greater kinetic energy near the equator than
elsewhere. The opposite problem occurs in \subfigref{j-jplus1-visual}{3}, where the wave is constant in the longitudinal
direction; at the poles, the wavefunction varies infinitely rapidly,
and therefore the kinetic energy blows up to infinity there. The only valid solution is
\subfigref{j-jplus1-visual}{2}, which has a Goldilocks-style just-right wavelength in the longitudinal direction.
The kinetic energy associated with this wavelength is the difference between the semiclassical
$\ell^2$ and the correct quantum mechanical $\ell(\ell+1)$. 

A different example that is particularly easy
to reason about is the wavefunction $\Psi_{10}$ shown in figure \figref{completeness-ylm}
on p.~\pageref{fig:completeness-ylm}, for $\ell=1$ and $\ell_z=0$. (The odd value of $\ell$ is possible for
a rotor that doesn't have mirror symmetry, e.g., the carbon monoxide molecule CO.) The ratio of the
correct quantum mechanical energy to the semiclassical one is $\ell(\ell+1)/\ell^2=2$, and the factor of
two  makes sense because at the poles, the wave has equal contributions to its kinetic energy due to
oscillations in the two perpendicular directions that occur in the Laplacian $\partial^2/\partial x^2+\partial^2/\partial y^2$.

\startdq

\begin{dq}
The correction of the semiclassical proportionality for the energy of a rotor from $\ell^2$ to $\ell(\ell+1)$
is effectively the addition of a correction equal to $\ell$. What if someone tells you that there is 
an additional correction term that depends only on $\ell_z$ (for a fixed $\ell$)? Is this plausible?
\end{dq}

\begin{dq}
Can the correction $\ell^2\rightarrow\ell(\ell+1)$ be tested experimentally by measuring the energy
of a spinning steel ring in the laboratory? Can the correction $n\rightarrow n+1/2$ be tested
using a cart on an air track that vibrates back and forth between two springs?

<% begin_sec("A tiny bit of linear algebra",nil,'linear-algebra',{'optional'=>true}) %>

This optional section is a self-contained presentation of a very small amount of
linear algebra. None of the later physics requires this material, but reading it
may be helpful as review for the reader who has already had an entire linear algebra
course, or to help make connections for the one who is taking such a course concurrently
or will take it in the future.

A \emph{vector space} is a set of objects, which we refer to as vectors,\index{vector space}\label{lin-alg-vector-space}
along with operations of addition and scalar multiplication
defined on the vectors. The scalars may be the real numbers or the complex numbers.
We require that the addition and scalar multiplication operations have the properties
that addition is commutative ($\vc{u}+\vc{v}=\vc{v}+\vc{u}$), that we have an additive
identity $\vc{0}$ and additive inverses ($\vc{v}+(-\vc{v})=\vc{0}$), and that both operations
are associative and distributive in the ways that we would expect from the notation.
The prototypical example of a vector space is vectors in three-dimensional space, with
the scalars being the real numbers.

\begin{eg}{The vector space of polynomials}
Consider the set of all polynomials.
If we define addition of polynomials and multiplication of a polynomial by a real
number in the obvious ways, then these functions are a vector space. Note that
there is no well-defined division operation, since dividing
a polynomial by a polynomial typically does not give a polynomial.
\end{eg}

In quantum mechanics, we are interested in the vector space of wavefunctions, with the
scalars being the complex numbers.

A set of vectors is said to be \emph{linearly independent} if it is not possible to form
the zero vector as a linear combination of them. 
For vectors in three-dimensional
space, a set of three vectors is not linearly independent if they lie in the same plane.
The set of polynomials $\{1,x\}$ is
linearly independent, but the set $\{P,Q,R\}$, where $P=1$, $Q=1-x$, and $R=1+x$,
is not, because $-2P+Q+R=0$.\index{linear independence} 

A \emph{basis}\index{basis for a vector space}\label{lin-alg-basis}
for a vector space is a linearly independent set of
vectors, called basis vectors, such that any vector can be formed as a
linear combination of basis vectors. The standard basis for vectors in
two-dimensional space is $\{\hat{x},\hat{y}\}$, while a possible basis
for the polynomials is the infinite set $\{1,x,x^2,x^3,\ldots\}$.  
A basis exists for any vector space, and in fact there are normally
many different bases to choose from, with none being preferred. In the
plane, for example, we can choose to rotate the standard $\{\hat{x},\hat{y}\}$ basis by any angle we like.
Every basis for a given vector space has the same number of elements, and this number is
called the \emph{dimension} of the vector space. The plane is a two-dimensional
vector space. The polynomials are an infinite-dimensional 
vector space.\index{basis of a vector space}\index{dimension of a vector space}

A \emph{linear operator} is a function $\mathcal{O}$ that takes a vector as an
input and gives a vector as an output, with the properties
$\mathcal{O}(\vc{u}+\vc{v})=\mathcal{O}(\vc{u})+\mathcal{O}(\vc{v})$ and
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha\vc{u})=\alpha\mathcal{O}(\vc{u})$.\index{linear operator}\label{lin-alg-linear-operator}
A rotation in the plane is a linear operator.

\begin{eg}{Differentiation as a linear operator}
Consider the set of all differentiable functions, taken as a vector space over either
the real numbers or the complex numbers. Then the derivative is a linear operator,
as is the second derivative.
The kinetic energy term in the Schr\"odinger equation is built out of second derivatives,
so it is a linear operator.
\end{eg}

For vectors in three-dimensional space, we have a dot product, which is a function
that takes two vectors as inputs and gives a scalar as its output. A vector space
may or may not come equipped with such an operation. If it does, we call the
operation an \emph{inner product}. The inner product on wavefunctions is introduced
in section \ref{subsec:qm-inner-product}, p.~\pageref{subsec:qm-inner-product}.
In quantum mechanics, the inner product is a basic tool used to define probabilities,
and for example normalization becomes the requirement that a wavefunction have an
inner product with itself that equals 1. That is, a normalized wavefunction is a kind
of unit vector.\index{inner product!on a general vector space}

When a vector space is finite-dimensional and a basis has been chosen, then if we wish we can represent
vectors in column vector notation. For example, in the space of first-order polynomials
with the basis $\{1,x\}$, the polynomial $3+5x$ can be represented by
$\left(\begin{smallmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$. Linear operators can
similarly be represented by matrices, but we will seldom find this possible or useful in this
book. For example, we can't represent the derivative as a matrix, because the vector space
is infinite-dimensional.\label{lin-alg-column-vec-notation}

<% begin_sec("The underlying structure of quantum mechanics, part 1",nil,'qm-structure-1') %>

So far we have been building up the structure of quantum mechanics by casually laying
one brick on top of another, but at this point it will be advantageous to pause and
consider the broader blueprint.

<% begin_sec("The time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation",nil,'time-dependent-s-eqn') %>

For simplicity, our discussion of the Schr\"odinger equation in section
\ref{subsec:schrodinger}, p.~\pageref{s-eqn-simplest-initial-statement}, was limited to standing waves, allowing us to avoid
explicitly discussing how the wavefunction changed with passing time. Let's consider
the generalization to the full time-dependent case.

Classically, suppose I show you a picture of a baseball next to a tree, and I ask you how
long it will take to hit the ground. You can't tell, because you also need information about the ball's initial
velocity. That is, the future time-evolution of the system $x(t)$ depends not just on the initial position $x(0)$
but also on its initial time derivative $x'(0)$.

But if I show you a uranium atom in its lowest energy state, you don't
need to know any other information to predict everything that can be
predicted about its future decay. Whereas the baseball could be thrown downward
in order to make it reach the ground more quickly, nobody knows of any way to
prepare the uranium nucleus in such a way that it is any more likely to decay
sooner. Knowing the initial wavefunction $\Psi(0)$ to be that of the ground state
lets us say as much as can be said about the future time-evolution $\Psi(t)$, and it's
neither necessary nor helpful to know the time derivative $\Psi'(t)$.

This is an example of a more general idea about the interpretation of
quantum mechanics, which is that the wavefunction is a complete
description of any system. There isn't more information that can be
known about the system.  This principle seems to be widely agreed upon
by physicists, but doesn't seem to have a standard name.  (The phase
and normalization of the wavefunction are not considered to
give\index{phase in quantum mechanics!not observable} any information,
since the phase is unobservable, and the normalization can be
standardized so that the total probability is 1. See the sidebar for more detail.)

the normalization, and its argument would only affect the phase. We do not mean, for example,
that wavefunctions like $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ are indistinguishable. The sine and cosine give different
probability distributions, so they are distinguishable. For example, the $\sin x$ wavefunction

\begin{important}[Wavefunction fundamentalism]
All knowable information about a system is encoded in its wavefunction (ignoring phase
and normalization).
\end{important}

\noindent An example of an idea that would violate this principle is
the pilot wave\index{pilot wave theory} theory proposed by de Broglie
around 1927, and improved by Bohm in the 1950's. In this theory, an electron-particle
is a separate object from an electron-wave, with the particle surfing
the wave along a deterministic trajectory.

Another example that shows the contrast with the classical description is that
if I show you a snapshot of a wave on a string, you can't tell which
direction it's going --- as with the baseball, you need to know its
initial velocity in addition. But
if I show you a snapshot of a quantum-mechanical traveling wave, you \emph{can} tell which
direction it's going, because of the complex phase, as shown in figures
\subfigref{rainbow}{2} and \subfigref{rainbow}{3} on page \pageref{fig:rainbow}.
Note that this mechanism wouldn't work if wavefunctions were always real numbers,
so wavefunction fundamentalism implies complex wavefunctions.

Given the wavefunction at some initial time, we can predict its evolution into the future
by making use of the principle that $E=hf$. Suppose for example that we have a sinusoidal plane wave
traveling to the right. Then we expect the value of the wavefunction at a particular point in space
to rotate clockwise about the origin in the complex plane at the appropriate frequency $f$, showing
a time dependence $e^{-i\omega t}$ (where, as usual, $\omega=2\pi f$). Thus the time derivative
of the wavefunction is $\Psi'=-i\omega\Psi=-i(E/\hbar)\Psi$, so that $E\Psi=i\hbar\Psi'$. Then to
generalize the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation to its time-dependent version, the most
obvious thing to try is simply to substitute $i\hbar\partial\Psi/\partial t$ for $E\Psi$, which gives
\begin{equation*}\index{Schr\"odinger equation!time-dependent}\label{s-eqn-time-dep}
  i\hbar\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t} = 
              -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 \Psi  +   U \Psi   .
\end{equation*}
(In section \ref{subsec:s-eqn-general}, p.~\pageref{subsec:s-eqn-general}, we will generalize this to cases where
the wavefunction is not expressed in terms of the spatial coordinates $x$, $y$, and $z$.)
Unlike Newton's laws of motion, which refer to a second derivative with respect to time, the Schr\"odinger equation
involves only a first time derivative. This is why we don't need initial data on $\partial\Psi/\partial t$, but only
$\Psi$: if we know $\Psi$, then the right-hand side of the Schr\"odinger equation is what \emph{gives}
us $\partial\Psi/\partial t$. But the Schr\"odinger equation has some other properties
that match up with those of Newton's laws. 

\begin{eg}{A plane wave}\label{eg:t-dep-s-eqn-plane-wave}
Consider a free particle of mass $m$ in one dimension, with the wavefunction
\begin{equation*}
  \Psi=e^{i(kx-\omega t)},
\end{equation*}
where $k=2\pi/\lambda=p/\hbar$ is called the wavenumber.
If $k$ and $\omega$ are both positive, we can tell that the particle is moving to the right, because the signs
inside the exponential are such that $x$ could increase as $t$ increases while
keeping the phase the same. This would happen for $k\Delta x-\omega\Delta t=0$,
or $v=\omega/k$, which is the phase velocity (not the same as the group
velocity, sec.~\ref{subsec:dispersive-waves}, p.~\pageref{subsec:dispersive-waves}).

Suppose that the particle is in free space, so that $U$ is constant,
and for convenience take $U=0$. Application of the Schr\"odinger
equation, $i\hbar\partial\Psi/\partial t=-(\hbar^2/2m)\partial^2\Psi/\partial x^2$, gives
$
  \hbar\omega e^{(\ldots)} = \frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m} e^{(\ldots)},
$
and if this is to hold true for all values of $x$ and $t$, then we must have
$
  \hbar\omega = \frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m},
$
which is simply an expression of the Newtonian relation $K=p^2/2m$, since $k\lambda=2\pi$ and $p=h/\lambda$.
Flipping the sign of $k$ results in an equally valid solution, and a negative $k$ is how
we would represent a wave traveling to the left.

We have two solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation corresponding to the two signs of $k$, and because
the Schr\"odinger equation is linear, it follows that we can make a more general solution of
the form
\begin{equation*}
  Ae^{i(kx-\omega t)}+Be^{i(-kx-\omega t)},
\end{equation*}
where $A$ and $B$ are any two complex
numbers. (We could also try to elaborate on this
theme by allowing for an arbitrary phase angle $\delta$ inside the complex exponentials, e.g.,
changing the argument of the first exponential to $i(kx-\omega t+\delta)$. However, this would
be equivalent to changing $A$ to $Ae^{i\delta}$, which is just a change in $A$'s phase angle, not
a new solution.)
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Dispersion of a wave packet}\label{eg:dispersion-of-wave-packet}
An annoying feature of example \ref{eg:t-dep-s-eqn-plane-wave} is that the wavefunction cannot be normalized
because it extends in all directions to infinity. This type of infinite plane wave
is at best an idealization of the wavefunction for a realistic example such an electron launched by a cathode
ray tube, or an alpha particle emitted by a nucleus. As a more realistic example, we might try something
like a wave packet, such as a pulse with a certain shape, traveling in a certain direction.
This works for waves on a string or for electromagnetic waves: the pulse or packet simply glides along
while rigidly maintaining its shape. To investigate this idea using the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation,
it will be convenient to adopt the frame of reference in which the particle is at rest. In this frame,
we would expect the wave to look frozen, just as an ocean wave looks frozen in place to a surfer who is
riding it. It must therefore be of the form
\begin{equation*}
  \Psi = e^{-i\omega t}f(x),
\end{equation*}
where $f$ is some function specifying the shape of the wave packet.
But this $\Psi$ is not a solution to the Schr\"odinger equation. On the left-hand side
of the Schr\"odinger equation, evaluating the time derivative gives
$\hbar\omega\Psi$, which is just the original wavefunction multiplied by a constant.
If we are to satisfy the Schr\"odinger equation, then the right-hand side, which is the second derivative
with respect to $x$, must also
be equal to the original wavefunction multiplied by a constant. But the only functions for which
$(\der^2/\der x^2)(\ldots)=(\text{constant})(\ldots)$ are exponentials and sine waves. An exponential shape
obviously isn't a physical realization of a wave packet. A sine wave
works, but it just describes an infinite plane wave like the one in example \ref{eg:t-dep-s-eqn-plane-wave}, not
a wave packet that can be localized and normalized.

The underlying reason for this result is that the Schr\"odinger equation is dispersive: waves with different wavelengths
travel at different speeds (because they correspond to different momenta). Suppose a pulse has the
shape $f(x)$ at $t=0$. Since a pulse is not a sine wave, it doesn't have a single well-defined wavelength, and therefore
it doesn't have a definite momentum or velocity. In fact, the spread in momentum must be at least a certain
size due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle $\Delta p\Delta x\gtrsim h$. This causes the pulse to spread out over time.

This leads to a strange thought experiment. Suppose that a uranium atom in the Andromeda galaxy emits an alpha particle,
which then travels thousands of light years and eventually flies past the earth. Its wave packet may initially have
been as narrow as the diameter of an atomic nucleus, $\sim 10^{-15}\ \munit$, but by the time it arrives perhaps it
is the size of an aircraft carrier. Will an observer see a gigantic alpha particle flying by? No, because observing
it constitutes a measurement of its position, and by the probability interpretation of the wavefunction this
measurement simply has a certain probability of giving a result that is anywhere within some region the size of
an aircraft carrier.

The Schr\"odinger equation is completely deterministic, so that if we know
$\Psi$ initially, we can always predict it in the future. We can also ``predict'' backward in time,
so that the system's history can always be recovered
from knowledge of its present state. Thus there is never any loss of information over time. Furthermore,
it can be shown that probability is always conserved, in the sense that if the wavefunction is initially
normalized, it will also be normalized at all later times.

\begin{important}[Unitary
         evolution of the wavefunction]\index{unitary evolution of the wavefunction}\label{unitarity-postulate}
The wavefunction evolves over time, according to the Schr\"odinger equation, in a deterministic
and \emph{unitary} manner,
meaning that probability is conserved and information is never lost.
\end{important}
\noindent(Unitarity is 
defined more rigorously on p.~\pageref{unitary-operator}.)

Since we think of quantum mechanics as being all about randomness, this determinism may seem surprising.
But determinism in the time-evolution of the wavefunction isn't the same as determinism in the results
of experiments as perceived and recorded by a human brain. Suppose that you prepare a uranium atom in
its ground state, then wait one half-life and observe whether or not it has decayed, as in the thought
experiment of Schr\"odinger's cat (p.~\pageref{schrodingers-cat}). There is no uncertainty or randomness about the wavefunction of the
whole system (atom plus you) at the end. We know for sure what it looks like.
It consists of an equal superposition of two states,
one in which the atom has decayed and your brain has observed that fact, and one in which the atom has
not yet decayed and that fact is instead recorded in your brain. 

To get more of a feeling for what is meant by unitarity, it may be helpful to consider some examples of
how it could be violated. One is the mythical ``collapse'' of the wavefunction in naive
interpretations of the
Copenhagen approximation (p.~\pageref{copenhagen-introduced}).\index{Copenhagen approximation!nonunitary}
Another example of nonunitarity is
given in example \ref{eg:non-hermitian-energy} on p.~\pageref{eg:non-hermitian-energy}.

A more exotic example is the disappearance of matter into a black hole.
If I throw my secret teenage diary into a black hole, then it contributes a little bit to the black
hole's mass, but the embarrassing information on the pages is lost forever. This loss of information
seems to imply nonunitarity. This is one of several arguments suggesting that quantum mechanics cannot
fully handle the gravitational force. Thus although physicists currently seem to possess a completely successful
theory of gravity (Einstein's theory of general relativity) and a completely successful theory of
the microscopic world (quantum mechanics), the two theories are irreconcilable, and
we can only make educated guesses, for example, about the behavior of a hypothetical microscopic black hole.

Quite a few of the interesting phenomena of quantum mechanics can be demonstrated by
finding solutions to the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation using the following ``cut and paste''
method. We break up the $x$ axis into pieces, where the potential $U(x)$ does different things,
and such that we already know the solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation for each piece.
We then splice together the different parts of the solution, requiring that no discontinuities
occur in the wavefunction $\Psi$ or its derivative $\partial\Psi/\partial x$. (If the momentum
and kinetic energy are to be finite, and $U$ is finite, then we need all derivatives up to the second to be
defined.)

<% begin_sec("Partial reflection at a step",nil,'s-eqn-partial-refl') %>

The simplest example of this kind is a potential step,
\begin{equation*}
  U(x) = \begin{cases}
    U_1, & x< 0 \\
    U_2, & x> 0,
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
where $U_1$ and $U_2$ are constants, and
the energy of the particle is such that both sides are classically allowed.
We have discussed this example \ref{eg:step-correspondence} on p.~\pageref{eg:step-correspondence},
where we cheated by drawing real-valued wavefunctions, and simply assumed that we could
still use our previous results for classical wave reflection (p.~\pageref{reflected-wave-amplitude}).
It is not actually obvious that we should be able to get away with recycling that result,
both because our quantum-mechanical wavefunctions are complex and because the
Schr\"odinger equation is dispersive, so we can no longer assume, as we did there,
that a wave packet simply glides along rigidly (example \ref{eg:dispersion-of-wave-packet}, p.~\pageref{eg:dispersion-of-wave-packet}).

      superposed, but are drawn as separate entities and offset for purposes of visualization.
    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

To sidestep the problem of dispersion, we will carry out our analysis using an
infinitely long wave-train with a definite wavelength. Let the incident wave have unit amplitude
and travel to the right,
\begin{equation*}
  \Psi_\zu{I} = e^{i(kx-\omega t)} \qquad \text{($x< 0$)},
\end{equation*}
as in example \ref{eg:t-dep-s-eqn-plane-wave}, p.~\pageref{eg:t-dep-s-eqn-plane-wave}.
Recall that the wavenumber $k$ is basically just momentum, $p=\hbar k$.

For the reflected and transmitted parts of the wave, we take
\begin{equation*}
  \Psi_\zu{R} = Re^{i(-kx-\omega t)} \qquad \text{($x< 0$)},  
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
  \Psi_\zu{T} = Te^{i(k'x-\omega t)} \qquad \text{($x> 0$)},
\end{equation*}
where the reflected and transmitted amplitudes $R$ and $T$ are unknown, and our goal
is to find them.
The different sign inside the exponential for $\Psi_\zu{R}$ corresponds to the opposite direction of motion
at the same speed $v$, while in the expression for $\Psi_\zu{T}$ we have motion to the
right, but with a different momentum $p'=\hbar k'$ as required by conservation of energy.

Demanding continuity of $\Psi$ gives
\begin{equation*}
  1+R = T.
\end{equation*}
The derivatives are 
$\partial\Psi_\zu{I}/\partial x=ik\Psi_\zu{I}$,
$\partial\Psi_\zu{R}/\partial x=-ik\Psi_\zu{R}$, and
$\partial\Psi_\zu{T}/\partial x=ik'\Psi_\zu{T}$, and evaluating these at
$x=0$, $t=0$ gives $ik$, $-ikR$, and $ik'T$. If the derivative is to be the same for $x\rightarrow0^-$
and for $x\rightarrow0^+$, we need to have $ik-Rik=iTk'$, or
\begin{equation*}
  1-R=\frac{k'}{k}T,
\end{equation*}
But these two equations are exactly the same as the ones found on p.~\pageref{reflected-wave-amplitude}
for a classical, nondispersive wave, the only difference being the replacement of
$v/v'$ with $k'/k$. To keep the writing simple, let $\alpha=k'/k$.
With this replacement, the solutions are the same as before,
$R=(1-\alpha)/(1+\alpha)$ and $T=2/(1+\alpha)$.
For a particle of energy
$E$, we can find the momentum ratio $\alpha$ using conservation of energy,
$\alpha=\sqrt{(E-U_2)/(E-U_1)}$.
There is partial reflection not just in the
case of a sudden rise in the potential, but also at a sudden drop
($U_2<U_1$), which is surprising and seems to violate the
correspondence principle, but actually does not, as discussed in
example \ref{eg:step-correspondence} on p.~\pageref{eg:step-correspondence}.

One of our principles of quantum mechanics is unitarity (p.~\pageref{unitarity-postulate}),
which says, in part, that probability is conserved. Normally we would interpret this to mean
that a wavefunction stays normalized if it was originally normalized. In this example, the wavefunctions
are not normalizable, but we still expect the fluxes of particles balance out.
We have
\begin{align*}
  \text{flux} &= (\text{probability density})(\text{group velocity}) \\
              &= \Psi^2\cdot \frac{p}{m} \\
              &= \frac{\hbar}{m} k \Psi^2,
\end{align*}
so that if we want
the total incident flux to equal the total outgoing flux, we need
\begin{equation*}
  k = k R^2 +k' T^2,
\end{equation*}
which is straightforward to verify.

In sec.~\ref{subsec:qm-bound-states}, p.~\pageref{subsec:qm-bound-states}, we analyzed the one-dimensional
particle in a box. There was nothing wrong with those results, but it is of interest to see how
they fit into the framework of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. If we want the walls of the box
to be completely impenetrable, then we should describe it using a potential such as
\begin{equation*}
  U(x) = \begin{cases}
    \infty, & x< 0 \\
    0, & 0<x<L,\\
    \infty, & x> L, 
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
shown in figure \subfigref{infinite-potential-well}{1}. Because the potential is infinite outside the box,
we expect that there is no tunneling, and zero probability of finding the particle outside.

<% marg(-30) %>

<%
  fig(
    'infinite-potential-well',
    %q{%
      A particle in a box.
    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

In general when we do the cut-and-paste technique, we expect both the wavefunction and its
first derivative to be continuous where the pieces are joined together. But because we 
have already solved this problem by more elementary methods, we know that there will be kinks
in the wavefunction at the walls of the box, $x=0$ and $L$. The kink is a point where the
second derivative $\partial^2\Psi/\partial x^2$ is undefined, and it's undefined because it's
infinite. The second derivative is essentially the kinetic energy operator, and normally it
would not be possible to have the kinetic energy be $\pm\infty$. But in this problem, it \emph{is}
reasonable to have a kinetic energy of $-\infty$, because the potential energy is $+\infty$.

Within the box, for a fixed energy $E=\hbar\omega$, the possible wavefunctions will be those
of a free particle, which we have already found. There are two possibilities, of the form
\begin{align*}
  \Psi_1 &= e^{i(kx-\omega t)} \\
  \Psi_2 &= e^{i(-kx-\omega t)},
\end{align*}
figure \subfigref{infinite-potential-well}{2},
where $k$ is a positive real number satisfying $k=p/\hbar=\sqrt{2mE}/\hbar$. $\Psi_1$ is
a wave traveling to the right, and $\Psi_2$ is a wave traveling to the left. The most
general solution will be a superposition of these,
\begin{equation*}
  \Psi = A\Psi_1+B\Psi_2.
\end{equation*}
Because the wavefunction has to be continuous at $x=0$, where $\Psi_1=\Psi_2$, we must have
$A+B=0$. Since $e^{iz}-e^{-iz}=2\sin z$, we end up with
\begin{equation*}
  \Psi = 2A\sin kx e^{-i\omega t}.
\end{equation*}
Throwing out the time-dependent phase, we get the sinusoidal solutions to the time-independent
Schr\"odinger equation that we have already found, e.g.,
figure \subfigref{infinite-potential-well}{3}. Imposing the additional constraint that
$\Psi$ be continuous at $x=L$, we get the condition $kL=n\pi$, where $n$ is an integer, and this makes the
energies quantized, as we found before.

\index{separability!Schr\"odinger equation}
When we first generalized the Schr\"odinger equations from one dimension to two and three dimensions,
a trick for finding solutions was to take solutions to the one-dimensional equation and
multiply them. For example, we knew that in the case of a constant potential (a free particle), the
one-dimensional time-independent equation had solutions of the form $\sin ax$ and $e^{ax}$.
We then saw in problem \ref{hw:three-d-forbidden}, p.~\pageref{hw:three-d-forbidden},
that $e^{by}\sin ax$ was a solution to the two-dimensional equation. This is because
the two-dimensional time-independent Schr\"odinger equation for a free particle, which has the form
\begin{equation*}
  \nabla^2\Psi = c\Psi,
\end{equation*}
has a property called \emph{separability}. What this means is that if functions $X$
and $Y$ are both solutions of the one-dimensional version of the equation, then
$\Psi(x,y)=X(x)Y(y)$ is a solution of the two-dimensional one. To see this, we calculate
\begin{align*}
  \nabla^2\Psi &= \nabla^2[X(x)Y(y)] \\
               &= \left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}\right)[X(x)Y(y)] \\
               &= Y(y)X''(x)+X(x)Y''(y).
\end{align*}
We're looking for functions $X$ and $Y$ such that
this is a solution to the two-dimensional equation, so that
\begin{equation*}
  Y(y)X''(x)+X(x)Y''(y) = cX(x)Y(y).
\end{equation*}
Dividing both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$ simplifies this equation to
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}+\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = c.
\end{equation*}
But if $X$ and $Y$ are solutions of the one-dimensional equation, then both terms on the left are
constants, so we have a valid solution to the two-dimensional equation.

As an example, we know that $\sin kx$ is a solution to the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation,
so the function $\sin kx \sin ky$ is also a solution. The result, shown in figure
\figref{separable-s-eqn}, can be chopped off and made into a solution of the two-dimensional
particle in a box. Solutions similar to this one are found in real-life examples such as
microwave photons in a microwave oven. For more about separability, and how it compares with
entanglement, see sec.~\ref{sec:more-entanglement}, p.~\pageref{sec:more-entanglement}.

By the time my first-year mechanics students have been in class for a week, they know how to answer
when I ask them the velocity of the tape dispenser at the front of the classroom: ``We don't know, it
depends on your frame of reference.'' The \emph{absolute} velocity of an object is a meaningless concept,
part of the mythical dungeons-and-dragons cosmology of Aristotelian physics. Quantum mechanics is as great
a break from Newton as Newton was from Aristotle, and similar care is required in redefining what concepts
are \emph{observables} --- meaningful things to talk about measuring.

\newcommand{\eqnimage}[1]{\raisebox{-.2\height}{\includegraphics[resolution=300]{../share/quantum/figs/#1}}}
% duplicated in FAC

Classically, we describe the state of the system as a point in phase
space (sec.~\ref{subsec:phase-space}, p.~\pageref{subsec:phase-space}) --- which is just a fancy way of
saying that we specify all the positions and momenta of its particles ---
and an observable is defined as a function that takes that
point as an input and produces a real number as an output. (By the way, the word ``phase'' in ``phase space''
doesn't refer directly to the phase of a wave, which we'll also be discussing below.)
For example, kinetic energy is a classical observable, and 
$K(\eqnimage{eqn-tennis-ball})=0$, where the picture represents
a tennis ball at rest. For a moving tennis ball with one unit of energy, 
$K(\eqnimage{eqn-tennis-ball-moving})=1$.
For a vibrating violin string, we could have 
$U(\eqnimage{eqn-wave2-small-amp})=1$, and $U(\eqnimage{eqn-wave2})=4$ (where doubling the amplitude gives
four times the energy).

Quantum-mechanically, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us that we can't
independently dial in the desired values of a particle's position and momentum. They aren't
two variables that are independent of one another. Therefore we don't have a phase space, so an observable
has to be represented by a function whose input is a wavefunction.
Furthermore, we expect that:
\begin{itemize}\label{operator-criteria}\index{phase in quantum mechanics!not observable}
\item The output shouldn't depend on the phase\footnote{``Phase'' as in the phase of a wave, not as in ``phase space.''} of the wavefunction.
\item The output shouldn't depend on amplitude (because a different amplitude might just mean an incorrectly normalized state).
\item The output should be well defined when we superpose any two states.
\end{itemize}
\noindent These requirements are hard to reconcile with the idea that
the output of the observable is just a real number representing the
result of the measurement. We could decree that the input wavefunction is just
required to be have the standard normalization, but there's no obvious
way to define a standardization of phase. And suppose we have a
particle in a one-dimensional box, with the two lowest energies being
$E(\eqnimage{eqn-wave1})=1$ and $E(\eqnimage{eqn-wave2})=4$.
Then what should we define
for the superposition $E(\eqnimage{eqn-wave1}+\eqnimage{eqn-wave2})$?
We could define it to be the average, 2.5, but
that isn't even a possible value of the measurement; in reality, the
result of the measurement would be either 1 or 4, with equal
probability.

For a clue as to a better way to proceed, note the structure of the
time-independent Schr\"odinger equation for a free particle, omitting all constant
factors like $m$, 2, and $\hbar$. It isn't $(\der^2/\der x^2)\Psi=E$, it's
$(\der^2/\der x^2)\Psi=E\Psi$. This fixes all the problems. For example,
if we change the phase of the wavefunction by flipping its sign, the equation
still holds with the same value of $E$. This equation is a specific example
of a more general type of equation that looks like
\begin{equation*}
  \text{operator}(\text{input}) = \text{number}\times\text{input}.
\end{equation*}
Another, simpler example is $(\der/\der x)f=3f$, which is satisfied if $f=Ae^{3x}$, where
$A$ is any constant.
Such an equation says that applying the operator to the input just gives back the
\emph{input itself}, multiplied by some constant. For this reason, this type of
equation is called an \emph{eigenvalue equation}, because ``\emph{eigen}'' is the
German word for ``self.'' We say that 3 is the eigenvalue of 
the eigenvalue equation $(\der/\der x)f=3f$.
In the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation, the eigenvalue is the energy,
and a solution $\Psi$ is called a state of definite energy (or
``eigenstate''). 

All observables in quantum mechanics are described by operators such as derivatives.
The second derivative (with the appropriate factor
of $-h^2/2m$) is the kinetic energy operator in quantum mechanics.
Given an operator $\mathcal{O}$ that describes a certain observable,
a state $\Psi$ with a definite value $c$ of that observable is one for which
$\mathcal{O}(\Psi)=c\Psi$. Although it's common to use parentheses when notating functions,
as in $\cos(\pi)=-1$, they are optional, and we can write $\cos\pi=-1$, so we will often
use notations like $\mathcal{O}\Psi$ instead of $\mathcal{O}(\Psi)$, but keep in mind
that this not multiplication, just as $\cos\pi$ doesn't mean multiplying $\cos$ by $\pi$.

When we carried over the classical kinetic energy observable to quantum mechanics, we weren't
going blind. For example, the factor of $-h^2/2m$ in front is tightly
constrained by requirements like units and the need for a traveling
sine wave to have positive energy. But for the superposition of two
states, classical mechanics will never give us any guidance. For
example, what is the body temperature of Schr\"odinger's cat? For the
energy operators appearing in the Schr\"odinger equation, we used linear operators.
The
result was that our law of physics was perfectly linear, and this is a
hard requirement, for the reasons described on p.~\pageref{subsubsec:linearity-of-schrodinger}.
It therefore seems natural to require that \emph{all} observables be represented by
linear operators,
\begin{equation*}
  \mathcal{O}(\Psi_1+\Psi_2)=\mathcal{O}\Psi_1+\mathcal{O}\Psi_2.
\end{equation*}
Indeed, if they were not linear, then quantum mechanics would lack
self-consistency, for the act of measurement can be described by applying the Schr\"odinger equation
to a big system consisting of the
system being observed interacting with the measuring device.

Finally, we have one more requirement, which is that the linear
operator representing an observable should have eigenvalues that are
real.\label{qm-why-hermitian-observables}
This isn't because the results of a measurement must logically
be real --- e.g., we can measure complex impedances. But in any
real-world application of the complex number system, we must always
choose some arbitrary phase conventions, such as that an inductor has a
positive imaginary impedance to represent the fact that the voltage
leads the current by 90 degrees. (Such phase conventions are always
arbitrary because we
define $i$ as $\sqrt{-1}$, but this doesn't distinguish $i$ from $-i$.)
These phase conventions are all independent of one another, and the
classical ones are independent of the convention used for
wavefunctions in quantum mechanics, which is that a state with positive
energy twirls clockwise in the complex plane. (See also example \ref{eg:non-hermitian-energy}, p.~\pageref{eg:non-hermitian-energy}.)

\begin{important}[Observables]
In quantum mechanics, any observable is represented by a linear operator that takes
a wavefunction as an input and has real eigenvalues.
\end{important}

\noindent Some important examples of observables are momentum (example \ref{eg:momentum-operator} below),
position (example \ref{eg:x-is-observable}),
energy, and angular momentum. These are represented by linear operators $\mathcal{O}_x$,
$\mathcal{O}_p$, $\mathcal{O}_E$, and $\mathcal{O}_L$, respectively.

\begin{eg}{The momentum operator}\label{eg:momentum-operator}
Quantum mechanics represents motion as a dependence of the wavefunction on
position, so that a constant wavefunction has no motion.
This suggests defining
the momentum operator as the derivative with respect to position.
This almost works, but needs to be tweaked a little.
We expect that a state of
definite momentum is a sine wave of the form $\Psi=e^{ikx}$. We have $k\lambda=2\pi$
and $p=h/\lambda=\hbar k$, and the sign is a matter of convention. Taking the
derivative of $\Psi$ gives an eigenvalue $ik$, which has the wrong units
(easily fixed by tacking on a factor of $\hbar$), but more
importantly is not real. This suggests defining the momentum operator
as 
\begin{equation*}
  \mathcal{O}_p=-i\hbar\frac{\der}{\der x}.
\end{equation*}
A further note about the momentum operator is example \ref{eg:imaginary-momentum} on
p.~\pageref{eg:imaginary-momentum}.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{A nonexample}\label{eg:not-an-observable}
Consider the one-dimensional particle in a box, and restrict our attention to
the two lowest-energy states and their superpositions.
Define an operator $\mathcal{O}$ by the rule
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal{O}(\eqnimage{eqn-wave1}) &= \eqnimage{eqn-wave2} \\
  \mathcal{O}(\eqnimage{eqn-wave2}) &= -(\eqnimage{eqn-wave1}) .
\end{align*}
Since $\mathcal{O}$ is linear, defining its action on $\eqnimage{eqn-wave1}$ and
$\eqnimage{eqn-wave2}$ suffices to define its action on the superpositions of these
states as well.
This operator
has eigenvalues, one of which is $i$, corresponding to the state
$\eqnimage{eqn-wave1}-i\eqnimage{eqn-wave2}$.
(It also has a second eigenvalue, which is imaginary as well.)
Because this operator doesn't have real eigenvalues, it is not a valid
observable.
\end{eg}

Note that in examples \ref{eg:momentum-operator} and
\ref{eg:not-an-observable}, it doesn't matter whether the operator is
\emph{defined} using complex numbers. Our definition of the momentum
operator was stated using an equation that had an $i$ in it, but its
eigenvalues are real, so that's OK. The operator $\mathcal{O}$ in
example \ref{eg:not-an-observable} was defined using only real
numbers, but its eigenvalues are not real. 

\begin{eg}{Position is an observable}\label{eg:x-is-observable}
If we have a wavefunction $\Psi(x)$ expressed as a function of position $x$, then
we simply take the operator for position $\mathcal{O}_x$ to be multiplication by the number $x$,
\begin{equation*}
  \mathcal{O}_x(\Psi)=x\Psi .
\end{equation*}
For example, if $\Psi=e^{ix}$ (ignoring units), then $\mathcal{O}_x(\Psi)=xe^{ix}$.
This operator is definitely linear, because multiplication by a number is linear, e.g.,
$7(a+b)=7a+7b$. The only question is whether it has eigenvalues, and whether those are
real. A state of definite $x$, say a state with $x=0$, would have to be represented by a wavefunction $\Psi(x)$
for which there was zero probability of having $x\ne0$, and this requires us to have
$\Psi(x)=0$ for nonzero $x$.
But what would be the value of $\Psi(0)$? It has to be \emph{infinite} if $\Psi$ is to be properly
normalized. With this motivation, the physicist P.A.M.~Dirac defined
the Dirac delta function,\index{Dirac delta function}\index{delta function (Dirac)}
\begin{equation*}
  \delta(x)=\begin{cases}
    0 & \text{for $x\ne0$} \\
    +\infty & \text{for $x=0$}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
Its graph is an infinitely narrow, infinitely tall spike at $x=0$, and it has
$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\delta(x)\der x=1$.
Mathematicians will shake their heads and say that this is not a definition of a function, but
it's very useful to pretend that it is, and the delta ``function'' is widely used in a variety of
fields such as electrical engineering. Because it was useful, mathematicians felt obliged to
define a theory in which functions are generalized to things called distributions or generalized functions.
\end{eg}

Because we represent an observable as an operator that changes a wavefunction into a new wavefunction,
a common misconception is that this change represents the effect of measurement on the system.
Although it is often true that microscopic systems are delicate, so that the act of measurement may have a
significant effect on them, that action of the operator on the wavefunction does not represent
that effect. For example, the position operator $\mathcal{O}_x$ from example \ref{eg:x-is-observable} consists simply
of multiplication of the wavefunction by $x$. Suppose we have a particle in a box with a wavefunction
given by $\Psi=\sin x$, where we ignore units and normalization, and the box is defined by
$0\le x\le \pi$. Then $\mathcal{O}_x\Psi$ eats the
input wavefunction $\sin x$ and poops out the new function $x\sin x$. But the act of measuring the
particle's position clearly can't do anything like this --- for one thing, the function $x\sin x$ 
has larger values on the right side of the box than on the left, but there is nothing to create
such an asymmetry in either the original state or the measuring process. The real-world effect of
the measurement would probably be to knock the particle out of the box completely, since a high-resolution
measurement will have a small uncertainty $\Delta x$, which by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle
means creating a large $\Delta p$.

Nor is it always true that measuring a system disturbs it. For example, suppose that we prepare a
beam of silver atoms, as in the Stern-Gerlach experiment, in such a way that every atom is guaranteed
to be in either a state of definite $L_x=+1/2$ or $L_x=-1/2$. That is, the beam may be a mixture of
both of these possibilities, but each atom is guaranteed have its spin either exactly aligned with
the magnetic field or exactly antiparallel to it. Then the effect of the magnetic field is simply
to sort out the two types of atoms according to spin, without having the slightest effect on those spins.

\begin{eg}{Phase is not an observable}\label{eg:phase-not-observable}\index{phase in quantum mechanics!not observable}
On p.~\pageref{operator-criteria} we listed three criteria for implementing the concept
of an observable in quantum mechanics, and one of these was that since wavefunctions that differ
only by a phase describe the same state, the result of an observation should not depend on phase.
For this reason, it should not be a surprise that the mathematical definition of an observable
that we came up with does not allow for the creation of an observable to describe measurement of
a phase.

By way of rigorous proof, suppose to the contrary that we did have such an observable
$\mathcal{O}_\zu{ph}$. By our definition of an observable, it would have to have some set of
eigenvalues that were real numbers. Consider such an eigenvalue $\varphi$, which might perhaps be
the argument of the wavefunction in the complex plane, although we will not need to assume that.
Let $\Psi$ be the state of definite phase having the phase $\varphi$, so that 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:phase-not-observable-1}
  \mathcal{O}_\zu{ph}\Psi = \varphi\Psi.
\end{equation}
We can change the phase of $\Psi$ to create a new wavefunction. Let's retard its
phase by 90 degrees, creating $i\Psi$. Since $\Psi$ was a state of definite phase, clearly
$i\Psi$ is as well, and and it must have some different eigenvalue $\varphi'$.
Perhaps $\varphi'=\varphi+\pi/2$, but in any case we must have $\varphi'\ne\varphi$. Then
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:phase-not-observable-2}
  \mathcal{O}_\zu{ph}(i\Psi) = \varphi'(i\Psi).
\end{equation}
But by linearity equation \eqref{eqn:phase-not-observable-2} is equivalent to $i\mathcal{O}_\zu{ph}\Psi=i\varphi'\Psi$, or
$\mathcal{O}_\zu{ph}\Psi=\varphi'\Psi$, and therefore by comparison with
equation \eqref{eqn:phase-not-observable-1}, $\varphi=\varphi'$, which is a contradiction, so
we conclude that there cannot be an observable representing phase.
\end{eg}

The result of example \ref{eg:phase-not-observable} was a bit of a
foregone conclusion, since we specifically designed our notion of an
observable to be insensitive to phase. Therefore this argument is
subject to the objection that perhaps there is some way to measure a
quantum-mechanical phase, but our definition of an observable is just
too restrictive to describe it.  However, we will see on p.~\pageref{measurement-randomizes-phase} that there
are more concrete reasons why phase cannot be measured. 

\begin{eg}{Time is not an observable}\label{eg:t-not-observable}
We do not expect to have a time operator in quantum mechanics. This
follows simply because an operator is supposed to be a function that takes a
wavefunction as an input, but we typically can't tell what time it is by looking at the
wavefunction. For example, if the electron in a hydrogen atom is in its ground state, then we
could say its energy is zero, so its frequency is zero, the period is infinite,
and the wavefunction doesn't vary at all with time. (We can choose our
reference level for the electrical energy $U_\zu{elec}$ to be anything we like.
Even if we choose it such that the energy of the ground state
is nonzero, the only change in the electron's wavefunction over time will be
a phase rotation, which by example \ref{eg:phase-not-observable} is not observable.)

Of course this doesn't mean that quantum mechanics forbids us from building clocks.
It just tells us that many
quantum mechanical systems are too simple to function as clocks. In particular,
we would be misled if we pictured a hydrogen atom classically in terms of an
electron traveling in a circular orbit around a proton, in which case it really
could act like the hand on a tiny clock. For further discussion of this idea, see
p.~\pageref{et-too-simple-to-be-a-clock}
\end{eg}

Since you've already studied relativity, you've had  carefully inculcated in you the
idea that space and time are to be treated symmetrically, as parts of a more general
thing called spacetime. The differing results of examples \ref{eg:x-is-observable} and \ref{eg:t-not-observable}
are clearly not consistent with relativity. This is to be expected because
the Schr\"odinger equation is nonrelativistic
(cf.~self-check \ref{sc:schrodingerassumptions}, p.~\pageref{sc:schrodingerassumptions}), and
the principles laid out in this section are the principles of \emph{nonrelativistic} quantum mechanics.

\begin{eg}{Parity}\label{eg:parity}
In freshman calculus you will have encountered the notion of even and odd functions. In quantum
mechanics, we can have even and odd wavefunctions, and they can be distinguished from one another
using the parity operator $\mathcal{P}$.\index{parity!operator in quantum mechanics}
If $\Psi(x)$ is a wavefunction, then $\mathcal{P}\Psi$ is a new wavefunction, call it $\Psi'$,
such that $\Psi'(x)=\Psi(-x)$. In other words, the parity operator flips the wavefunction
across the origin. (In three dimensions, we negate all three coordinates.) States of definite
parity are represented by wavefunctions that are even (eigenvalue $+1$) or odd ($-1$).
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{States of definite angular momentum}
In section \ref{subsec:qm-corrections}, p.~\pageref{subsec:qm-corrections}, we saw that the kinetic
energy of a quantum mechanical rotor is proportional not to $\ell^2$ but instead to 
$\ell(\ell+1)$. This was justified qualitatively in terms of the solutions of the 
Schr\"odinger equation for a particle on a sphere, but in fact there is a deeper reason, which is
that the eigenvalues of the orbital angular momentum operator turn out to be $\ell(\ell+1)$.
The parity of such a state is $(-1)^\ell$, which can be seen in figure \figref{hydrogen-three-states}
on p.~\pageref{fig:hydrogen-three-states}.
\end{eg}

If we have two observables, it may or may not be possible to measure them both on the same state
and get exact and meaningful results. Position and momentum $p$ and $x$ are incompatible observables, as expressed
by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. No state is simultaneously a state of definite $p$ and of definite
$x$. The magnitude of an angular momentum $L$ and its component along
some axis $L_z$ are compatible. It is common to have a state that is simultaneously a state of definite
$L$ and of definite $L_z$. Another example of \emph{incompatible} observables is $L_z$ and $L_x$, as proved
on p.~\pageref{proof-lx-and-lz-incompatible}.

<% begin_sec("The inner product",nil,'qm-inner-product') %>

We've defined the normalization of a wavefunction as the requirement $\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\Psi^*\Psi\der x=1$,
which means that the total probability that the particle is \emph{somewhere} equals 1.
(Another way of writing $\Psi^*\Psi$ would be $|\Psi|^2$.) This assumes that the wavefunction is written as
a function of the position $x$. But it is also possible to have a wavefunction that depends on some other
variable, such as spin or momentum, or on some combination of variables, e.g., both the spin $s$ and the position $x$
of an electron, $\Psi(x,s)$. We can also use a wavefunction to describe a correlation between
multiple particles, in which case the wavefunction might look like $\Psi(x_1,x_2)$. The variables that the wavefunction
depends on may be either continuous, like position and momentum, or discrete, like spin or angular momentum.
Given all of these possibilities, we need to figure out an appropriate generalization of the integral over $x$
that we originally used to define our normalization condition. To provide for flexibility and generality, we
will start by simply defining a new notation that looks like this:
\begin{equation*}
  \langle \Psi | \Psi \rangle = 1.
\end{equation*}
In the case where $\Psi$ is a function of $x$ alone, the angle brackets $\langle\ldots|\ldots\rangle$ basically
mean just an integral over $x$, and we think of the $\langle\ldots|$ part as automatically implying the complex
conjugation of the thing inside it. The operation $\langle\ldots|\ldots\rangle$ is called the
\emph{inner product}.\index{inner product!in quantum mechanics}

      The vectors notated with right-hand angle brackets like $|\ldots\rangle$ are the ones that
      we could represent as column vectors (p.~\pageref{lin-alg-column-vec-notation}) if the vector space is finite-dimensional.
      Left-hand angle brackets are like row vectors. A row vector multiplied by a column vector
      is a way of notating an inner product,
      which is the same idea as a notation like $\langle\ldots|\ldots\rangle$. To turn a column vector
      into a row vector, we transpose it and take complex conjugates of its elements. This is analogous
      to the rule of taking complex conjugates when converting back and forth between left-hand angle
      brackets (``bras'') and right-hand ones (``kets''). In both contexts, the basic reason for the
      complex conjugation is that we want the inner product of a vector with itself to be a positive real number.
    }
  })
%>
<% end_marg %>

Because negative probabilities don't make sense, we require that the inner product of a wavefunction with itself
always be positive,
\begin{equation*}
  \langle u | u \rangle \ge 0.
\end{equation*}
This makes it similar to the dot product used with vectors in Euclidean geometry.

In the case of Euclidean geometry, the ability to add vectors and measure their lengths automatically
gives us a way to judge the similarity of two vectors. For example, if $|u|=1$, $|v|=1$, and $|u+v|=2$,
then we conclude that $u$ and $v$ are in the same direction. On the other hand, if
$|u|=1$, $|v|=1$, and $|u+v|=\sqrt{2}$, then we can tell that $u$ and $v$ are perpendicular, which makes
them as different as two unit-length vectors can be. More generally, $(u+v)\cdot(u+v)=|u|^2+|v|^2+2u\cdot v$,
because the dot product is linear, so we can see that the information about how similar $u$ and $v$ are
is all contained in their dot product $u\cdot v$. Making the analogy with quantum mechanics, we expect that
since we can define normalization of wavefunctions, we should automatically get, ``for free,'' a way of
measuring how similar two states are.

With this motivation, we assume that there is an inner product on wavefunctions that has properties
analogous to those of the dot product. We assume linearity, so that if $u$, $v$, and $w$ are wavefunctions,
then
\begin{align*}
  \langle u | \alpha v+\beta w \rangle = \alpha\langle u | v \rangle + \beta\langle u | w \rangle \\
\intertext{and}
  \langle \alpha u+\beta v | w \rangle = \alpha^*\langle u | w \rangle + \beta^*\langle v | w \rangle .
\end{align*}
In the second equation, we need to take the complex conjugates $\alpha^*$ and $\beta^*$, for if we omitted the
conjugation, then when $\langle u | u \rangle=1$ we would have $\langle iu | iu \rangle=-1$, describing a negative
probability. For similar reasons, we require that
\begin{equation*}
  \langle u | v \rangle = \langle v | u \rangle^*
\end{equation*}
rather than the more familiar property of the Euclidean dot product $u\cdot v=v\cdot u$.

\begin{important}[Inner product]
Wavefunctions come equipped with an inner product that has the properties described above.

%>
<% end_marg %>

If we're dealing with wavefunctions that are expressed as functions of position, then it's pretty clear
how to define an appropriate inner product: $\langle u | v \rangle = \int u^*v \der x$.
The inner product axiom stated above then requires that this (possibly improper) integral converge in all cases, which
means, for example, that we have to exclude infinite plane waves from consideration. However, because it's
so convenient sometimes to talk about plane waves, we may break this rule when nobody is looking.
Note the similarity between the expression $\int u^*v \der x$ and the expression
$u_xv_x+u_yv_y+u_zv_z$ for a dot product: the integral is a continuous sum, and the dot product is
a discrete sum.

Two wavefunctions have a zero inner product if and only if they are completely distinguishable from each other
by the measurement of some observable. By analogy with vectors in Euclidean space, we say that
the two wavefunctions are orthogonal.\label{orthogonal-wavefunctions}
For example, $\langle \eqnimage{eqn-wave1} | \eqnimage{eqn-wave2} \rangle=0$, as can be verified
from the integral $\int_0^\pi \sin x \sin 2x \der x=0$. These states are also distinguishable by measuring
either their momentum or their energy.

Let's consider more carefully the general justification for this
assertion that perfect distinguishability is logically equivalent to a zero inner product.
We have described valid observables in quantum mechanics as being represented by operators that have
real eigenvalues. An alternative description of such
an operator $\mathcal{O}$,
called a hermitian operator\footnote{The mathematician's standard definition of a hermitian
operator adds an additional technical condition, which is that all of the operator's eigenvalues should
have magnitudes below a certain fixed bound. This is much too restrictive for our purposes, since, for
example, an alpha particle in free space can have an arbitrarily large kinetic energy. In fact, nothing
really bad happens if we relax our requirement for quantum-mechanical operators to be that they
merely need a property called being 
\emph{normal}.\index{normal operator}}  after 
Charles Hermite,\index{hermitian operator}\label{hermitian}
is that it is one such that for any $u$ and $v$, the equation
$\langle \mathcal{O} u|v\rangle = \langle  u|\mathcal{O} v\rangle$ holds.\footnote{Proof
that a hermitian operator has real eigenvalues:
Let $e$ be an eigenvalue, $\mathcal{O}u=eu$ for $u\ne0$. Then
$\langle \mathcal{O} u|u\rangle = \langle  u|\mathcal{O} u\rangle$, so
$\langle e u|u\rangle = \langle  u|e u\rangle$, and
$e^*\langle u|u\rangle = e\langle  u| u\rangle$,                   
so $e^*=e$, meaning that $e$ is real.}
Being hermitian is, for an operator, analogous to being real for a number.
(Cf.~problem \ref{hw:trivial-nonhermitian}, p.~\pageref{hw:trivial-nonhermitian}.) Just as a randomly chosen
complex number is unlikely to be real, a randomly chosen linear operator will almost never be hermitian.
Like love, patriotism, or beauty, a nonhermitian operator fails to translate into anything a physicist
can measure.

Using this alternative characterization of what makes a valid observable, we can prove, as claimed above,
that if two states are distinguishable because they have definite, different values of
some observable, then they are orthogonal.\footnote{Proof:
Consider states $u$ and $v$ with $\mathcal{O} u=e_1 u$
and $\mathcal{O} v=e_2 v$. If $\mathcal{O}$ is Hermitian, we have
$\langle \mathcal{O} u|v\rangle = \langle u|\mathcal{O}v\rangle$, so
$e_1^*\langle u|v\rangle=e_2 \langle u|v\rangle$. But since $e_1$ and $e_2$ are real and unequal, we must have
$\langle u|v\rangle=0$.}

Suppose that $u$ and $v$ are both properly normalized wavefunctions. If $|\langle u|v \rangle|=1$, then the
states are identical.\footnote{If the inner product is, for example, $-1$, then the wavefunctions differ only by
an unobservable difference in phase, so they really describe the same state.}
If $\langle u|v \rangle=0$, then $u$ and $v$ are completely distinguishable from one another. There is
also the intermediate case where $\langle u|v \rangle$ has a magnitude greater than 0 but less than 1.
In this case, we could say that $u$ is a mixture of $v$ plus some other state $w$ that is distinguishable
from $v$, i.e., that
\begin{equation*}
  |u \rangle = \alpha |v \rangle + \beta |w \rangle.
\end{equation*}
where $\langle v|w \rangle=0$. We then have
\begin{equation*}
  \langle u|v \rangle = (\alpha \langle v | + \beta \langle w |)|v \rangle = \alpha.
\end{equation*}
Now suppose that we make measurements capable of determining whether or not the system
is in the state $v$. If the system is prepared in state $u$, and we make these measurements on it, then
by the linearity of the Schr\"odinger equation, the result is that the measuring apparatus or observer ends up in
a Schr\"odinger's-cat state that looks like
\begin{equation*}
  \alpha |\text{observed $v$} \rangle + \beta |\text{observed $w$} \rangle.
\end{equation*}
We interpret squares of amplitudes as probabilities, so
\begin{equation*}
  P=|\alpha|^2=|\langle u|v \rangle|^2
\end{equation*}
gives us the probability that we will have observed the state to be $v$. This final leap in the logic,
to a probability interpretation, has felt mysterious to several generations of physicists, but recent
work has clarified the situation somewhat.

On p.~\pageref{exclusion-principle-nonrigorous} we stated the Pauli exclusion principle
by saying that two particles with half-integer spins
could never occupy the same state.\index{exclusion principle}\index{Pauli exclusion principle}\label{exclusion-principle-rigorous}
This was not a completely rigorous definition of the principle, since 
we didn't really define ``same state.'' A more mathematically precise statement is that
if one electron's wavefunction is $u$ and another's is $v$, then $\langle u|v\rangle=0$.
In other words, we are ruling out not just the case where $u$ and $v$ are the same wavefunction,
$\langle u|v\rangle=1$, but also the intermediate case where $\langle u|v\rangle$ is greater than 0 but less than 1.

A unitary transformation\index{unitary operator}\label{unitary-operator}
is one that preserves inner products. That is,
$\langle\mathcal{O}u|\mathcal{O}v\rangle=\langle u|v\rangle$. This is similar to the way in which
rotations preserve dot products in Euclidean geometry. This provides a more rigorous definition
of what we meant by postulating the unitary evolution of the wavefunction
(p.~\pageref{unitarity-postulate}).\index{unitary evolution of the wavefunction}
It can be shown that if the Hamiltonian is hermitian, then the evolution of the wavefunction
over time is a unitary operation. This protects us from bad scenarios like the one described
in example \ref{eg:non-hermitian-energy}, p.~\pageref{eg:non-hermitian-energy}.

\begin{eg}{Traveling waves in the quantum moat}\label{eg:moat-orthogonal-traveling-waves}
On p.~\pageref{subsubsec:degeneracy} we discussed the ``quantum moat,'' in which
a particle is constrained to a circle like the moat around a castle. For the $\ell=1$
state, the two degenerate traveling wave solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation
are (ignoring normalization) the counterclockwise $|\text{ccw}\rangle=e^{i\theta}$
and the clockwise $|\text{cw}\rangle=e^{-i\theta}$. These states are distinguishable
by their angular momenta $\ell_z=\pm 1$, so we expect them to be orthogonal. Let's
check that directly.
\begin{align*}
  \langle \text{ccw} | \text{cw} \rangle &= \int_0^{2\pi} \left[(e^{i\theta})^*\right]e^{-i\theta} \der \theta \\
            &= \int_0^{2\pi} e^{-i\theta}e^{-i\theta} \der \theta \\
            &= \int_0^{2\pi} e^{-2i\theta} \der \theta \\
\end{align*}
This is easily seen to be zero without an explicit calculation,
because when we take the antiderivative of $e^{-2i\theta}$, we will get the same
type of exponential, whose values when we plug in the upper and lower
limits of integration will cancel each other out.

\begin{eg}{Imaginary momentum?}\label{eg:imaginary-momentum}
Here's a paradox. If we take a wavefunction $e^{rx}$, where $r$ is a constant, then applying
the momentum operator $\mathcal{O}_p=-i\der/\der x$ (example \ref{eg:momentum-operator}, p.~\pageref{eg:momentum-operator}) gives
\begin{equation*}
  \mathcal{O}_p e^{rx} = -ir e^{rx}.
\end{equation*}
For a state of definite momentum, we normally have in mind, as in examples \ref{eg:momentum-operator}
and \ref{eg:moat-orthogonal-traveling-waves},
an oscillating wave where $r=ik$ is purely imaginary. But what if $r$ is real, say $r=1$ (ignoring units)? Then
our wavefunction is $e^x$, and it's a state of definite momentum --- \emph{imaginary} momentum.
Oh no, what's going on? Nice polite observables like momentum aren't supposed to have imaginary eigenvalues.

The resolution to this paradox lies in the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics that we've learned.
Wavefunctions are supposed to belong to a vector space in
which we have a well-defined inner product. A wavefunction like $\Psi=e^x$ is ruled out by this requirement,
because $\langle \Psi|\Psi\rangle$ is infinite, and therefore undefined.

Of course we could raise the same objection to a wavefunction like $\Phi=e^{ikx}$ defined for all real values
of $x$. But when we work with wavefunctions like $\Phi$, we usually just have in mind a computational
shortcut, with the actual wavefunction being some kind of wavepacket or wave train consisting of a finite
number of wavelengths. (Or we could be talking about rotation, as in the quantum moat
of example \ref{eg:moat-orthogonal-traveling-waves}. Note that in such an example, oscillating functions
can be made to join smoothly to themselves as they wrap around, but this doesn't work with
functions like $e^x$.)

The average family lives down the street from me. Their family income in 2014 was \$72,641,
and they have 2.5 kids. This joke depends on the fact that you can't superpose families to
make a single family --- but we \emph{can} do this for wavefunctions. Suppose that the
particle-in-a-box wavefunction $\eqnimage{eqn-wave1}$ has a definite energy of 1 unit,
$\mathcal{O}_E\eqnimage{eqn-wave1}=1\eqnimage{eqn-wave1}$. This says that $\eqnimage{eqn-wave1}$
is a state of definite energy 1, so that when we act on it with the energy operator
$\mathcal{O}_E$, the result is just to multiply the wave by 1 (the eigenvalue).

If this is true, then shortening the wavelength by a factor of
2 means increasing the momentum by a factor of 2, and increasing the energy by a factor
of 4. Therefore the wavefunction $\eqnimage{eqn-wave2}$ has 4 units of energy
$\mathcal{O}_E\eqnimage{eqn-wave2}=4\eqnimage{eqn-wave2}$.

Now there is nothing wrong with mixing these together to get a state 
$\Psi=c\eqnimage{eqn-wave1}+c'\eqnimage{eqn-wave2}$. If both $c$ and $c'$ are nonzero,
then we expect to get a state with properties in between those of
$\eqnimage{eqn-wave1}$ and $\eqnimage{eqn-wave2}$.  If we measure the energy
of such a state, then our wavefunction becomes entangled with that of the
particle, and we look like this:
\begin{equation*}
 c\fbox{\parbox{30mm}{We measured the energy to be 1.}}
+c'\fbox{\parbox{30mm}{We measured the energy to be 4.}}.
\end{equation*}
Suppose we make the mixture an equal one, $c=c'$. Then the average should be $(1+4)/2=2.5$.
This turns out to be easily expressible using an inner product:
\begin{equation*}
  \langle \Psi|\mathcal{O}_E \Psi \rangle = 2.5.
\end{equation*}
It's a good exercise to work this out for yourself 
(problem \ref{hw:two-point-five-kids}, p.~\pageref{hw:two-point-five-kids}).\label{two-point-five-kids}
The key point is that
$\Psi$ can be expressed as a superposition of states of definite energy
$\Psi=c\eqnimage{eqn-wave1}+c'\eqnimage{eqn-wave2}$, and when
the operator $\mathcal{O}_E$ works on $\Psi$, it gives
$\mathcal{O}_E\Psi=c\eqnimage{eqn-wave1}+4c'\eqnimage{eqn-wave2}$. (And remember
that by normalization, $|c|=|c'|=1/\sqrt{2}$.)

This is a general rule for calculating averages: for a state $\Psi$, the
average value for an observable $\mathcal{O}$ is $\langle \Psi|\mathcal{O} \Psi \rangle $.
Because observables are hermitian, this is the same as $\langle \mathcal{O}\Psi| \Psi \rangle $.

We have used math to back up our claim that distinguishable states are orthogonal.
Going in the opposite direction, suppose that $\langle u|v\rangle=0$. How can we then conclude that
there exists some observable $\mathcal{O}$ that can distinguish them? There is no straightforward
mathematical reason why
this must be true, but it would not make sense physically to talk about two states that were utterly distinct
and yet indistinguishable by any experiment. We therefore take this as a postulate.\footnote{Our statement
of the completeness principle refers to taking a sum of wavefunctions.
Because the physical motivation for the completeness postulate is so appealing, physicists are willing to
stretch the definition of the word ``sum'' in order to make it true. The sum can be an infinite sum,
and in certain cases we may even need to make it an integral, which is a kind of continuous sum.
For example, consider a one-dimensional particle in a box.
A complete set of observables for this
system can be found by picking the energy operator alone. Now
suppose we throw a particle in the box, in such a way that its
position is equally likely to be anywhere in the box, i.e., its wavefunction is supposed to
be constant throughout the box. Ignoring normalization, this constant wavefunction can be expressed as an infinite
series in terms of the states of definite energy as
$\eqnimage{eqn-wave1}+\frac{1}{3}\eqnimage{eqn-wave3}+\frac{1}{5}\eqnimage{eqn-wave5}+\ldots$
This kind of representation of a function as an infinite sum of sine waves is called a Fourier series.}

\begin{important}[Completeness]\label{qm-completeness-stated}
For any system of interest, there
exists a set of compatible observables, called a complete set, such that
any state of the system can be expressed as a sum of wavefunctions having definite values of these 
observables.

%>
<% end_marg %>

The set of wavefunctions referred to above is called a basis. (The terminology
comes from linear algebra.) If we
require normalization and ignore the undetectable phase, then choosing
a complete set of observables is equivalent to choosing a basis.
Therefore ``choice of basis'' and ``choice of a complete set of
observables'' are nearly synonyms, so we will usually use the shorter
phrase.  Normally there is more than one possible choice of basis.
The choice from among these possibilities is arbitrary, and nature doesn't
care which one we pick. That is, there is \emph{no preferred basis}.\label{no-preferred-basis}
An example of this principle is the fact that we habitually talk about ``up'' and
``down'' for the spin of an electron, which we are free to do, although it would
be equally permissible to talk about left and right. Another good example
is the discussion of the double degeneracy of the quantum moat on p.~\pageref{subsubsec:degeneracy},
where we were free to talk about a basis consisting of either two standing waves or two traveling waves.

As an example of the completeness principle, we have seen in example
\ref{eg:completeness-ylm} on p.~\pageref{eg:completeness-ylm} that for
a rotor, the state with $\ell=1$ and $\ell_x=0$ can be written as a
sum of the states with $\ell_z=-1$ and $\ell_z=1$. In the language of
the completeness postulate, we can express this as follows. Let our
system be the set of possible states of a rotor. The observables $L$
and $L_z$ are compatible, and they turn out (although we will not
prove it here) to be a complete set of observables for this system.
The completeness postulate is satisfied in this example because, as
shown in example \ref{eg:completeness-ylm},
p.~\pageref{eg:completeness-ylm}, the state with $\ell_x=0$ can be
expressed as $|\ell_z=-1\rangle/\sqrt{2}+|\ell_z=1\rangle/\sqrt{2}$.

<% end_marg %>

Translating this scenario into a hypothetical real-world experiment, suppose that, as in
figure \figref{stern-gerlach-twice}, we pass a beam of randomly oriented oxygen molecules
(referred to as an unpolarized beam)
through a Stern-Gerlach spectrometer that disperses them into beams with $\ell_x=-1$, 0, and $+1$.
All three states are present, and in fact the beam is split into three beams of equal intensity, $1/3$
that of the original beam.\footnote{The equality of these three intensities is not obvious geometrically,
but becomes more plausible if you consider the randomness of the unpolarized beam as being defined by
its having maximum entropy.}
Then we throw away all but the molecules having $\ell_x=0$,
and pass these through a second spectrometer, this one selecting states according to their
$\ell_z$. You can simulate experiments like this using an app
at \url{physics.weber.edu/schroeder/software/Spins.html}.
We have already found that the wavefunction of the
intermediate beam is equal to the sum
$|\ell_z=-1\rangle/\sqrt{2}+|\ell_z=1\rangle/\sqrt{2}$,
so interpreting squares of amplitudes as probabilities we predict a probability $(1/\sqrt{2})^2=1/2$
that each particle will be measured to have $\ell_z=-1$, the same probability for $-1$, and
zero probability for 0.
As explored in discussion question \ref{dq:stern-gerlach-twice-qualitative} on 
p.~\pageref{dq:stern-gerlach-twice-qualitative}, this does \emph{not} mean that
the two beams that emerge from the second spectrometer have definite values of
both $\ell_x$ and $\ell_z$; those two observables are not compatible.

In most of the examples we've encountered so far, it has been possible
to think of the ``wavefunction'' as exactly what the word implies: a
mathematical function of $x$ (and possibly also of $y$, and $z$),
whose shape we visualize as a wave. The completeness principle,
however, does not assign any special role to the position operator,
nor does quantum mechanics in general. And there are cases where we do
not even have the option of resorting to the picture of a wave that
exists in space. For example, the intrinsic angular momentum $\hbar/2$
of an electron is not a possible amount of angular momentum for a
particle to generate by moving through space. In section
\ref{subsec:qm-proton-in-b}, p.~\pageref{subsec:qm-proton-in-b},
we will discuss a very simple quantum-mechanical system consisting of
an electron, at rest, surrounded by a uniform magnetic field.  In this
example, the motion of the electron through space is not even of
interest, and a complete set of observables simply consists of $L$ and
$L_z$ (or $s$ and $s_z$, in notation that emphasizes that we're
talking about intrinsic spin).

\index{Schr\"odinger equation!time-dependent}
This raises the question of what we mean by ``the Schr\"odinger equation'' in cases where nothing is being expressed as a function
of $x$. The basic idea of the Schr\"odinger equation is that a particle's energy is related to its frequency by $E=hf$, or $E=\hbar\omega$.
In the form of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation that we have discussed on p.~\pageref{s-eqn-time-dep},
$i\hbar\partial\Psi/\partial t=-(\hbar^2/2m)\nabla^2 \Psi+U\Psi$, the quantity on the right-hand side of the equation is just
the energy operator acting on the wavefunction. So to generalize this to cases where the wavefunction isn't expressed in terms of $x$,
we just make that substitution:
\begin{equation*}
  i\hbar\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t} = \mathcal{O}_E \Psi.
\end{equation*}
This is as good a point as any to introduce a not-very-memorable
piece of terminology, which is that the energy operator in quantum mechanics
is called the \emph{Hamiltonian},\index{Hamiltonian} after W.R.~Hamilton. There is a classical
version of the Hamiltonian, which is usually a synonym for the energy of
a system, although it turns out that there are cases where it is not the same, e.g.,
when we adopt a rotating frame of reference. In both classical and quantum mechanics,
the Hamiltonian is what determines the time-evolution of a system; in quantum mechanics,
this is because it is the Hamiltonian that occurs in the Schr\"odinger equation.
Because the Hamiltonian occurs so frequently, we will notate it as $\hat{H}$ rather than
the more cumbersome $\mathcal{O}_E$, where the hat is to remind us that it is an operator.
A similar notation can be used for other operators when it is easier to write, e.g.,
$\hat{s}_z$ rather than the clumsy $\mathcal{O}_{s_z}$. In the hat notation,
the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation looks like this:
\begin{equation*}
  i\hbar\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \Psi.
\end{equation*}

\begin{eg}{An illegal energy operator}\label{eg:non-hermitian-energy}
We have pointed out on p.~\pageref{qm-why-hermitian-observables} some reasons to think that
it would be bad to have a quantum-mechanical observable whose eigenvalues were not real, i.e.,
one represented by a non-hermitian operator (p.~\pageref{hermitian}). Even worse things happen
if we try to use a non-hermitian operator for our energy operator, the Hamiltonian.
As the simplest possible example, consider a system consisting of a particle at rest, and
the Hamiltonian defined by
\begin{equation*}
  \hat{H}\Psi = ik\Psi,
\end{equation*}
where $k$ is a nonzero real constant with units of energy.
That is, the energy of the system is a constant value, which is the imaginary number $ik$.
This operator has a single eigenvalue, $ik$, which is not real. The fact that it has a non-real
eigenvalue is equivalent to a statement that it is non-hermitian (problem \ref{hw:trivial-nonhermitian},
p.~\pageref{hw:trivial-nonhermitian}). If we plug this in to the Schr\"odinger equation, we get 
$i\hbar\partial\Psi/\partial t=ik\Psi$, or
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t} = \frac{k}{\hbar}\Psi.
\end{equation*}
This differential equation is not hard to solve by the guess-and-check method. A function whose
derivative is itself (except for a multiplicative constant) is an exponential. The solution is
\begin{equation*}
  \Psi = Ae^{(k/\hbar)t},
\end{equation*}
where $A$ is a constant. This is bad. Very bad. If $\Psi$ is properly normalized at $t=0$, then
it will not be normalized at other times. If $k$ is positive, then the total probability will
become greater than 1 for $t>0$, which we could perhaps interpret as meaning that the particle
is spawning more copies of itself. Almost as bad is the case of $k<0$, for which the particle
exponentially vanishes into nothingness like the Cheshire cat. Either behavior would violate
the principle of the unitary evolution of the wavefunction (p.~\pageref{unitarity-postulate}).

<% begin_sec("Summary of the structure of quantum mechanics",nil,'qm-summary') %>

We can now summarize the logical structure of quantum mechanics using the following five
principles.

\begin{enumerate}

\item \emph{Wavefunction fundamentalism:} All knowable information
about a system is encoded in its wavefunction (ignoring phase and
normalization). 

\item \emph{Inner product:} Wavefunctions come equipped with an inner product that has the properties
$\langle u | \alpha v+\beta w \rangle = \alpha\langle u | v \rangle + \beta\langle u | w \rangle$
and $\langle u | v \rangle = \langle v | u \rangle^*$.

\item \emph{Observables:} In quantum mechanics, any observable is
represented by a linear operator $\mathcal{O}$ that takes a wavefunction as an input
and is hermitian, $\langle \mathcal{O} u|v\rangle = \langle  u|\mathcal{O} v\rangle$.

\item \emph{Unitary evolution of the wavefunction:} The wavefunction
evolves over time, according to the Schr\"odinger equation 
$i\hbar \partial\Psi/\partial t=\hat{H}\Psi$, in a
deterministic manner.
Because $\hat{H}$ is an observable, the Schr\"odinger equation is
\emph{linear} and also \emph{unitary}. Unitarity means that
$\langle u(t)|v(t) \rangle = \langle u(t')|v(t') \rangle$,
so that probability is conserved and information is never lost.

\item \emph{Completeness:} For any system of interest, there
exists a set of compatible observables, called a complete set, such that
any state of the system can be expressed as a sum of wavefunctions having definite values of these 
observables.

As an application of the ideas discussed in section \ref{sec:qm-structure-2}, let us consider the example
of a proton at rest in a uniform magnetic field. We will find that this very simple example
has surprising properties, and also that it throws light on much more general ideas than
would be expected, given how specific the situation is. We discuss the proton because the
physics is then the physics of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which is the technology used
for, among other things, medical MRI scans.
\index{NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance)}\index{MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)|see {NMR}}

% SN doesn't have the semiclassical description that LM has as eg:nmr.

Classically, the proton feels no magnetic force because it is at rest, and also because the
field is uniform (unlike the one in the Stern-Gerlach experiment). Therefore we expect it to stay
at rest. Its energy is $-\vc{m}\cdot\vc{B}$, and for the reasons discussed 
in sec.~\ref{subsec:g-factor}, p.~\pageref{subsec:g-factor},
the magnetic dipole moment $\vc{m}$ is proportional
to the spin angular momentum vector $\vc{s}$, so that the energy can be broken up into a sum of
three terms as $ks_xB_x+ks_yB_y+ks_zB_z$, where $k$ is $-1/g$ times the proton's charge-to-mass ratio.

Quantum-mechanically, the components of the magnetic field will act
like ordinary numbers (since the field is static, and we aren't trying
to describe its dynamics quantum-mechanically), but the components of
the angular momentum are observable properties of the proton, to be
represented by operators.  There is not always a foolproof procedure
for translating a classical expression into something
quantum-mechanical, but in this example it seems sensible to imagine
that the classical expression for the energy can be made into a
quantum-mechanical energy operator that is obtained simply by
substituting the components of the angular momentum operator into the
expression.

What we have determined so far is that the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$
will simply be a weighted sum of $\hat{s}_x$, $\hat{s}_y$, and $\hat{s}_z$,
with the weighting determined by the components of the
magnetic field.

\newcommand{\emat}{\varepsilon}
\newcommand{\fmat}{\mathcal{f}} % lowercase script, requires package dutchcal, see simple.cls

From our previous study of angular momentum in quantum mechanics, we
know that a full description of our proton's angular momentum can be given by
specifying the magnitude of the angular momentum, which is a fixed $\hbar/2$,
and its component along some arbitrarily chosen axis, say $z$. We have a state
$|\uparrow\rangle$ which has eigenvalue $s_z=+\hbar/2$, and
a $|\downarrow\rangle$ with $-\hbar/2$. If the magnetic field
is parallel to the $z$ axis, then the action of the Hamiltonian is easy to define
in terms of these two states,
\begin{align*}
  \hat{H} |\uparrow\rangle = \quad &\emat|\uparrow\rangle \qquad \text{and} \\
  \hat{H} |\downarrow\rangle = -&\emat|\downarrow\rangle,
\end{align*}
where to keep the notation compact we write $\emat=k\hbar/2$, which is an energy.
The interpretation is that if there is no external magnetic field ($k=0$), then
the energies of these two states are the same (and set to zero because we choose that
as an arbitrary definition), while in the presence of a $B_z$ the two energies
become unequal. The pair of states is ``split'' in energy by the field. Note that
the above two equations are sufficient to define
the Hamiltonian for \emph{all} states, not just for states in which $s_z$ has a definite
value. This follows from the completeness principle --- a state having a definite
value of, say, $s_x$ can be written as some kind of linear combination of the form
$\alpha|\uparrow\rangle+\beta|\downarrow\rangle$, and we then have
$\hat{H}=\alpha\emat |\uparrow\rangle-\beta\emat|\downarrow\rangle$.

      In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which is the technological basis for medical MRI scans,

      Protons in hydrogen atoms have their spin states split in energy by 
      by $\Delta E=2\emat=k\hbar$. After $\sim1\ \sunit$, the protons reach a new thermal equilibrium state in which
      the probability of $|\downarrow\rangle$ and $|\uparrow\rangle$ differ by $\sim10^{-5}$.

      A brief radio-frequency pulse
      is then applied at the frequency $\omega$ such that $\Delta E=\hbar\omega$, so that a radio photon
      has the correct energy to cause a transition between the two spin states. Since there is a large
      number of protons, and they interact with one another, their response can be described semiclassically.
      The magnetization vector of the sample precesses in a complicated manner, which can be affected
      by the polarization and duration of the pulse.

      After the radio pulse has stopped, the protons return to equilibrium again, and this changing magnetic
      field causes induced electric fields in a coil, which picks up a signal at the frequency $\omega$.
      Spatial resolution for imaging is accomplished by adding a gradient to the magnetic field, amounting

Now suppose that the magnetic field is not parallel to the $z$ axis. One way to handle
this situation would be simply to redefine the coordinate system so that the $z$ axis
was back in alignment with the direction of the field. But suppose that's not convenient.
Then the Hamiltonian will have a different form. But because the Hamiltonian must be Hermitian
(see p.~\pageref{hermitian}), there is not much freedom in choosing this form. It must
look something like this:
\begin{align*}
  \hat{H} |\uparrow\rangle =    &\emat|\uparrow\rangle + \fmat|\downarrow\rangle \\
  \hat{H} |\downarrow\rangle =  &\fmat^*|\uparrow\rangle-\emat|\downarrow\rangle.
\end{align*}
Here the constant $\fmat$ is a complex number with units of energy. The interpretation is
that $\emat$ tells us how much energy splitting we would have had if the magnetic field
had not had any $x$ or $y$ components, while $\fmat$ brings in the effect of those components.
We could go ahead and work out the eigenvalues of this operator by writing down the eigenvalue
equation and solving it by brute force, but the result is likely to seem less mysterious if
we instead apply the following physical argument.

Although $\fmat$ lies at some point in the complex plane with some
phase angle $\operatorname{arg}\fmat$, such phase angles in quantum
mechanics are not directly observable.  Since energies \emph{are}
observable, it follows that the two eigenvalues of energy can only
depend on the magnitude of $\fmat$, not on its phase. By rotational
invariance (sec.~\ref{subsec:rotationalinvariance},
p.~\pageref{subsec:rotationalinvariance}), we also know that these
energies can only depend on $|\vc{B}|=\sqrt{B_x^2+B_y^2+B_z^2}$, and
in fact when the direction of the field is fixed they must be
proportional to $|\vc{B}|$ (not to, e.g., the cube of the field). We
have already interpreted $\emat$ as being essentially $B_z$, except
for a constant of proportionality, so it follows from units that the
energies must be of the form
$E=\pm\sqrt{\emat^2+(\ldots)|\fmat|^2}=\pm\sqrt{\emat^2+(\ldots)\fmat^*\fmat}$,
where $(\ldots)$ represents a universal unitless constant, which turns
out to be 1. We therefore have for the energies the result
\begin{equation*}
  E=\pm\sqrt{\emat^2+\fmat^*\fmat}.
\end{equation*}
Note that our earlier result of $E=\pm \emat$ is recovered when $\fmat=0$.

<% begin_sec("The ammonia molecule",nil,'qm-ammonia') %>

I chose the example of the proton in a magnetic field in the preceding section for ease
of computation, but the treatment of the general case where $\fmat\ne0$ may not have seemed
especially compelling, since we would always have the freedom to align our $z$ axis with the
field, giving $\fmat=0$. But our results from that analysis are of much greater generality.
They do not depend on any facts about the system other than the fact that it is a system
with two states. To see the full power and generality of this approach, we will apply it to the ammonia
molecule, $\zu{NH}_3$, shown in figure \figref{ammonia}.

At ordinary temperatures, this molecule is likely to be rotating, and
its angular momentum will have some component about its symmetry axis
(the left-right axis in the diagram). Let's say, for example, that the
angular momentum vector points to the right, which we'll say is the positive
$x$ direction.  Then the two
orientations of the molecule shown in figure \figref{ammonia} are
distinguishable.  In one, the electric dipole vector (example
\ref{eg:molecular-dipoles}, p.~\pageref{eg:molecular-dipoles}) points
in the same direction as the angular momentum vector, and in the other
they point in opposite directions.\footnote{This argument shows that when $L_z\ne0$
we have two distinguishable states, but it does not necessarily tell us anything
about the converse. When $L_z=0$, are there two states, or only one? The analysis
in this case is rather intricate, and depends on the Pauli exclusion principle and
the fact that the hydrogen atoms are all identical, that there are three of them,
and that their nuclei are fermions. See Townes and Schawlow, Microwave 
Spectroscopy, 1955, pp.~69-71.} For a fixed angular momentum, we
have a two-state system, as in section \ref{subsec:qm-proton-in-b}. 

Classically, the molecule's moment of inertia is the same for
orientations \subfigref{ammonia}{1} and \subfigref{ammonia}{2}, so we
would expect there to be two states with the same energy.  We can
always add an arbitrary constant to the energies, so if they're the
same, we can just say they're both zero.  Does this mean that
quantum-mechanically, we simply have $\hat{H}=0$? That would be
boring. But this cannot be true, for the following reason. According
to the Schr\"odinger equation, a state of definite energy is a state
that has a definite frequency, so it lasts forever, just twirling its
phase angle around in the complex plane at a rate $\omega=E/\hbar$. So
if state 1 were a state of definite energy, then according to the
Schr\"odinger equation if we initially put the molecule in state 1 it
would stay in that state forever. But this cannot be the case, because
we know it is possible for the molecule to switch from state 1 to
state 2 by turning itself inside out like an umbrella caught by a gust
of wind. The possibility of this type of inversion is not just an
optional thing. Vibrations that flex the shape will exist due to
zero-point motion (p.~\pageref{zpm}). Even if inversion requires a lot
of energy, and the molecule doesn't have that much energy, there is at
least some probability of having quantum-mechanical tunneling from 1
to 2. If we prepare the molecule in state 1, and then observe it at
some later time, there is some nonzero probability of finding it in
state 2. This is a contradiction, so our assumption of $\hat{H}=0$
must have been false.

So the Hamiltonian is not zero, but we already know the full variety of forms that
the Hamiltonian of a two-state system can have. We only have a couple of parameters
to play with, the numbers $\emat$ and $\fmat$. 
We have $\emat=0$
by symmetry, so the only possible form for the Hamiltonian is this:
\begin{align*}
  \hat{H}|1\rangle &= \fmat |2\rangle \\
  \hat{H}|2\rangle &= \fmat^* |1\rangle.
\end{align*}
Because
we can define the states $|1\rangle$ and $|2\rangle$ with any phases we like, we
are free to take $\fmat$ to be real, $\fmat^*=\fmat$, although this implies a certain relationship \emph{between} the phases of $|1\rangle$ and $|2\rangle$.
If we visualize these states as bell-shaped functions of an $x$ coordinate describing the position of the nitrogen relative to the plane of the hydrogens,
then it would be nice to have a phase convention such that where the tails of the wavefunctions overlap, inside the barrier, they have the
same phase. This turns out to be the case when $\fmat$ is real and negative, so we will assume that from now on.
Recycling our previous result for the energies, we have $E=\pm\sqrt{\emat^2+\fmat^2}=\pm\fmat$.
If the tunneling probability approaches zero, then we expect $\fmat$ to go to zero,
and the energy splitting approaches zero, as we had expected classically. Experimentally,
we do observe these two states in ammonia. The difference in energy is extremely small ---
e.g., for the state with angular momentum $1\hbar$ it is about $9.8\times10^{-5}\ e\zu{V}$, so that if a photon is emitted or absorbed in a transition between the
states, it lies in the microwave spectrum.
% calc -x -e "f=23.69448 10^9 Hz; E=hf; E/(e(1 V))"
%     9.7992486739923*10^-5
This energy difference equals $2|\fmat|$, and its smallness indicates that the tunneling probability is small.

Let's find the states of definite energy for this system. For the ground state, whose energy is $-|\fmat|$,
we need to look for a state of the form $|\text{g.s.}\rangle=(\ldots)|1\rangle+(\ldots)|2\rangle$
such that $\hat{H}|\text{g.s.}\rangle=-|\fmat||\text{g.s.}\rangle=\fmat|\text{g.s.}\rangle$. If we don't worry about normalization
or an over-all phase, we are free to take the first $(\ldots)$ equal to 1, so that
$|\text{g.s.}\rangle=|1\rangle+\alpha|2\rangle$, for some complex number $\alpha$. We then
have
\begin{align*}
  \hat{H} |\text{g.s.}\rangle &= \hat{H}(|1\rangle+\alpha|2\rangle) \\
       &= \fmat |2\rangle+\alpha \fmat |1\rangle,
\end{align*}
and setting this equal to $\fmat|\text{g.s.}\rangle$ gives $\alpha=1$, so that
\begin{equation*}
  |\text{g.s.}\rangle = |1\rangle+|2\rangle.
\end{equation*}
The coefficients $(\ldots)$ that we set out to find are both equal to $+1$.
Their equal magnitudes tell us that the ground state is one in which the molecule has an \emph{equal} probability
of existing in either inversion. Since the two coefficients are both positive, and we have defined
$|1\rangle$ and $|2\rangle$ such that their phases agree when they overlap inside the barrier, this is
a state of positive parity. The determination of the excited state is left as an exercise, problem
\ref{hw:ammonia2} on p.~\pageref{hw:ammonia2}.

From a classical point of view, we would think of the set of states
\begin{equation*}
  \{\ |1\rangle,\ |2\rangle\ \}
\end{equation*}
as the natural way of describing the possible states of the system. These two states
are the ones that we can draw pictures of, \subfigref{ammonia}{1} and \subfigref{ammonia}{2}.
But part of the structure of quantum mechanics is that there is \emph{no preferred basis}
(p.~\pageref{no-preferred-basis}), and there is nothing wrong with using the ground state and first
excited state to form the basis
\begin{equation*}
  \{\ |\text{g.s.}\rangle,\ |\text{ex.s.}\rangle\ \}
\end{equation*}
instead. In the language of the completeness principle (p.~\pageref{qm-completeness-stated}),
one possible choice of a complete set of compatible observables for this molecule is
the set consisting of a single observable, the energy. The
\{ground-state,excited-state\} basis just happens to be the one associated with this
particular observable. If the ammonia molecule had just broken off from some larger molecule,
then it would be oriented in a specific direction, and we would probably find it more
convenient to describe it in the \{1,2\} basis.

Consider the following classical system of analogies.

\begin{tabular}{llll}
space & $x$ & $k$      & $\Delta x\Delta k \gtrsim 1$ \\
time  & $t$ & $\omega$ & $\Delta t\Delta \omega \gtrsim 1$ 
\end{tabular}

\noindent Here the quantity $k=2\pi/\lambda$ is called the wavenumber.\index{wavenumber}
The inequality $\Delta x\Delta k \gtrsim 1$ is a kind of classical uncertainty
relation that is closely related to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
Its classical nature is immediately apparent because it doesn't involve Planck's constant.
If you look back at the argument given on p.~\pageref{heisenberg-argument}
to justify the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, you will see that it carries
through equally well if we simply omit the quantum-mechanical ingredients and
use it to put a bound on $\Delta x\Delta k$ instead of $\Delta x\Delta p$. Once
we've established the bound on $\Delta x\Delta k$, the one on $\Delta x\Delta p$
follows immediately because $p=h/\lambda=\hbar k$.

The second line of the table is in strict analogy to the first line.
A good practical example is the high-speed transmission of digital
data over transmission lines such as fiber-optic cables. Suppose that
we wish to send a string of 0's and 1's, and a 1 is to be represented
by a square pulse. If we want to transmit the data at high speed, then
we need the duration $\Delta t$ of this pulse to be short, perhaps in
the microsecond or even nanosecond range. This cannot be done if the
signal consists only of a single frequency. A signal that only
contains a single, pure frequency is just a sinusoidal wave that has
existed infinitely far back in the past and will exist infinitely far
into the future. Such a wave carries no information at all. Out
frequency-time uncertainty relation tells us that if the duration of a
pulse is to be, say, a microsecond, then the signal's spread in
frequency much be at least on the order of 1 MHz. This is why we use
the term ``bandwidth'' to describe the speed of a communication
channel. 

<% end_sec('classical-uncertainty') %>

<% begin_sec("Energy-time uncertainty",nil,'et-uncertainty-subsubsec') %>

In a quantum-mechanical context, we have $E=\hbar\omega$, so there is
an energy-time uncertainty relation,
\begin{equation*}
  \Delta E\Delta t \gtrsim \hbar.
\end{equation*}
As with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for momentum and position,
the symbol $\gtrsim$ means that we leave out a numerical factor, which can
only be precisely defined if we fix some specific statistical definition of
$\Delta$, e.g., a standard deviation.

The interpretation of the energy-time uncertainty relation is a little
tricky, because although the classical analogy between space and time
is exact, the quantum-mechanical analogy breaks down. This is because
time in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, unlike position, is not an
observable (example \ref{eg:t-not-observable}).  Time in this theory
is just a universal parameter. The physicist Lev Landau liked to tell
his students that there was no energy-time uncertainty relation,
because ``I can measure the energy, and look at my watch; then I know
both energy and time!'' One good way of interpreting it is that if
there is a transfer of energy between two systems, then it relates
the uncertainty $\Delta E$ in the amount of energy transferred during the
duration $\Delta t$ of the interaction.

For example, suppose we wish to bounce a photon off of a hydrogen atom
in order to determine whether the atom is in its ground state. This is
not necessarily an easy thing to do by extracting whatever information
we get from the reflected photon, but the ground state is orthogonal
to the other states, so we are at least encouraged to believe that it
is not theoretically impossible. But there is a hard theoretical limit
on how \emph{quickly} we can make such a determination. The difference
in energy between the ground state and the first excited state is
$1.6\times10^{-18}\ \junit$, so we must use a photon with an energy
less than this amount, or else the act of observing the atom may in
fact destroy the property we were hoping to measure. By the
energy-time uncertainty relation, this implies that the measurement
process cannot be done in less than about $10^{-15}$ seconds.  This
example may seem impractical, but in fact computer memories are
starting to reach the level of speed and miniaturization at which such
fundamental constraints become relevant.

\begin{eg}{Mortality for hydrogen}
In atomic physics, when a photon is emitted or absorbed it is almost always
in a wave pattern with angular momentum 1 (i.e., $1\hbar$) and negative parity (example \ref{eg:parity}).
Classically, this is the type of radiation pattern that we would get from an electric dipole spinning
end over end, so we call it an electric dipole transition.
Because the electromagnetic interaction has a symmetry between left- and right-handedness
(section \ref{subsec:em-parity}, p.~\pageref{subsec:em-parity}), this means that
an electric dipole transition can never cause a transition from one state of an atom to another
state with the same parity.

Now the ground state of the hydrogen atom has $\ell=0$ and is therefore a state of positive parity.
One of the first excited states, referred to as the 2s state, also has these properties, and therefore
it is impossible for the 2s state to decay to the ground state by emitting an electric dipole photon.
The happy atom probably believes that once it's in the exalted 2s state, it can stay that way forever.
One way for it to be cheated of immortality is if it undergoes a collision with another atom, but
in some so-called planetary nebulae (hot clouds of gas cast off by dying stars), the density
can be so low that collisions are very infrequent. In this situation, the dominant process for
decay of the 2s state can be the simultaneous emission of \emph{two} photons. An exact and rigorous
calculation of the rate of decay for this process is quite technical, but a fairly reasonable estimate
can be obtained by the following semiclassical argument based on the energy-time uncertainty relation.

The typical rate of emission for a photon, when not forbidden by
parity, is $R\sim10^9\ \sunit^{-1}$, i.e., it takes about a nanosecond.
We can think of the two-photon decay as an energy-nonconserving jump
up to some \emph{higher}-energy state, with the emission of a photon,
followed by the emission of a second photon leading down to the ground
state. The first jump can happen because of the energy-time
uncertainty relation, which allows the electron to stay in the
intermediate state for a time $t\sim h/E$, which is on the order of
$10^{-15}\ \sunit$.  The probability for the second photon to be
emitted within this time is $Rt$, so the rate for the whole two-photon
process is $R^2t\sim 10\ \sunit^{-1}$.  Considering the extremely
crude nature of this calculation, the result is in good agreement with
the observed rate of about $0.1\ \sunit^{-1}$. The process is actually
observed, and contributes a continuous background spectrum in addition to
the discrete line spectrum when such nebulae are observed with a spectrometer
through a telescope.

A fundamental application of the energy-time uncertainty relation is to the explication of
what it means to measure time in quantum mechanics. In example \ref{eg:t-not-observable}
on p.~\pageref{eg:t-not-observable} we argued that time is not an observable in quantum mechanics
because time cannot in general be measured by looking at a quantum-mechanical system:
many quantum-mechanical systems are too simple to function as clocks.\label{et-too-simple-to-be-a-clock}
We can now see in more detail what ``too simple'' might mean here. Microscopic systems, unlike
macroscopic ones, are often encountered in a definite state of energy, such as the ground state.
Such a state has $\Delta E=0$ and therefore by the energy-time uncertainty relation it has
$\Delta t=\infty$. In other words, the only time evolution in such a system consists of the system's
over-all phase twirling in the complex plane at a steady rate, but phase isn't measurable, so we
can't use this rotation like the hand on a clock. To make a clock, we need, at a bare minimum, a
system that is in a superposition of \emph{two} different energy levels. We then have two independent
phases. Although absolute phases are not measurable, relative ones are, and for example when we measure
a double-slit interference pattern, that is exactly what we are doing: observing (statistically) the
difference between two phases. As a loose conceptual analogy, this is like the idea that a figure-eight
Lissajous pattern has an identifiable feature where it crosses itself, the crossing being like the tick
of a clock.

The energy-time uncertainty relation can help us to understand one of the most
puzzling issues in quantum mechanics, which is the problem of measurement.\index{quantum mechanics!measurement problem}
What happens
when we use a macroscopic measuring device, which is well described by classical physics,
to observe a microscopic system, which is quantum-mechanical? How do we reconcile these two seemingly
incompatible descriptions of reality when both appear to be in play simultaneously?

Consider an electron passing through a double-slit apparatus. We have already considered
the possibility of covering one slit (discussion question \ref{dq:cover-one-slit}, p.~\pageref{dq:cover-one-slit}).
Suppose instead that we carefully watch one slit through a microscope, and see whether or not the electron
passed through it. If we could perform this observation without disturbing the electron, then
a paradox would arise. For if we haven't disturbed the electron, then there should still be
a double-slit interference pattern. But if we watch one slit, then half of the time we should
see that the electron did not go through it, and therefore the slit's existence is of no importance,
and we can't possibly get a double-slit interference pattern.

<%

    %q{%
      Spying on one slit in the double-slit experiment.

  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

To avoid this contradiction, it appears that nature must conspire\label{measurement-randomizes-phase}
against us in such a way that observing the slit inevitably
\emph{does} disturb the electron. The energy-time uncertainty relation
explains why this is so. Our observation of the electron is an
interaction between the electron and our macroscopic measuring device.
This interaction will presumably transfer some amount of energy $E$
into or out of the electron, and if our goal was to avoid disturbing
the electron, we would imagine that it would be best to make $E$ very
small. But the energy-time uncertainty $\Delta E\Delta t\gtrsim h$
relation tells us that if this energy is to have a value that is
confined to some small range $\Delta E$, then the time $\Delta t$ it
takes for the interaction to occur must be at least $\sim h/\Delta E$.
While the electron is being subjected to this interaction, its
phase is rotating around the complex plane like $e^{i\omega t}=e^{i
Et/\hbar}$.  The total change in the phase angle $\phi=E\Delta
t/\hbar$ is uncertain because $E$ is uncertain, so our observation
will inevitably change the phase by some random amount, which is
uncertain by an amount $\Delta\phi=\Delta E \Delta t/\hbar$, so
$\Delta\phi \gtrsim 1$.

Thus is won't actually help us if we make the
interaction very gentle, because the lengthening of the time has a
compensating effect. Any slight alteration in the frequency will have more
time to accumulate into a big phase difference, and we still end up with a phase uncertainty that
is at least on the order of 1. Although we haven't stated our
uncertainty relations with enough mathematical precision to state this
lower bound with all the right factors of 2 and $\pi$, it turns out
that $\Delta\phi \ge 2\pi$. That is, any such observation will have
the effect of \emph{completely} randomizing the phase of the thing
being observed. In fact, macroscopic measuring devices normally exceed
the bounds set by the uncertainty relations by many orders of
magnitude, so there will typically be a vast amount of overkill in
this randomization. This is a general rule for reasoning about quantum-mechanical
measurements: they always completely randomize the quantum-mechanical phase of the thing being
measured. This provides a more physical justification for our more abstract mathematical proof
in example \ref{eg:phase-not-observable} on p.~\pageref{eg:phase-not-observable} that phase is
not an observable.

In our example of the double slit, what will be the effect of this randomization of the electron's
phase? In our usual description of the double slit, we assume that the circular waves emerging
from one slit are in phase with those that come out through the other one,
so that the double-slit interference pattern has a maximum in the
center. But if, for example, one of the waves has its phase inverted, then all the maxima of our
interference pattern will become minima and vice versa. If the phase is randomized, then the positions
of the maxima and minima are randomized as well, and thus if we try to collect data on enough electrons
to see an interference pattern, we will not see maxima and minima at all.

One subtle question about this description is the following. The randomization of the phase
by the measurement appears to have erased the information about the phase relationship between
the parts of the wave in the two slits. But how can this be, since one of our principles of quantum mechanics
(p.~\pageref{subsec:qm-summary}) is that time evolution is always unitary, so no information
is ever supposed to be lost? The resolution of this paradox is that the phase information still
exists, but it has been taken away from the electron and flowed out into the observer and the
environment. This is similar to the classical paradox of what happens to the (classical) information
written on a piece of paper when we burn the paper: the information still exists, and could in
principle be reconstructed by observing all the molecules and tracing their trajectories back
in time using Newton's laws.\label{unitarity-phase-randomization}

<% begin_sec("Decoherence",nil,'decoherence') %>
\index{decoherence}
Starting around 1970, physicists began to realize that ideas involving a loss of coherence,
or ``decoherence,'' could help to explain some things about quantum mechanics that
had previously seemed mysterious.  The classical notions of coherence and coherence length
were described in sec.~\ref{subsec:coherence}, p.~\pageref{subsec:coherence}, and quantum-mechanical
decoherence was briefly introduced on p.~\pageref{decoherence-brief}.

One mystery was the fact that it is difficult to
demonstrate wave interference effects with large objects. This is partly because
the wavelength $\lambda=h/p=h/mv$ tends to be small for an object with a large mass.
But even taking this into account, we do not seem to have much luck observing,
for example, double-slit diffraction of very large molecules, even
when we use slits with appropriate dimensions and a detector with a good enough angular
resolution.

In the early days of quantum mechanics, people like Bohr and Heisenberg imagined that
there was simply a clear division between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds.
Big things and small things just had different rules: Newton's laws in one case, quantum
mechanics in the other. But this is no longer a tenable position,
because we now know that there is no limit on the distance scales over which quantum-mechanical
behavior can occur. For example, a communication satellite carried out a demonstration
in 2017 in which a coherence length of 1200 km was demonstrated using 
photons.\footnote{Yin \emph{et al.}, \url{arxiv.org/abs/1707.01339}}

The insight about decoherence was the following. Consider the most massive material
object that has so far been successfully dif\-fracted through a grating,
which was a molecule consisting of about 810 atoms in an experiment by
Eibenberger \emph{et al.} in 2013.\footnote{\url{arxiv.org/abs/1310.8343}}
While this molecule was propagating through the apparatus as a wave, the experimenters
needed to keep it from simply being stopped by a collision with an air molecule.
For this reason, they had to do the experiment inside a vacuum chamber, with an extremely
good vacuum. But even then, the molecule was being bombarded by photons of infrared light
emitted from the walls of the chamber. The effect of this bombardment is to disrupt the
molecule's wavefunction and reduce its coherence length (p.~\pageref{fig:coherence}).

<%
  fig(
    'decohering-wave-packet',
    %q{%
      A large molecule such as the one in the Eibenberger experiment is represented by its
      wavepacket. 
      As the molecule starts out, its coherence length, shown by the arrows, is quite long.
      As it flies to the right, it is bombarded by infrared photons, which
      randomize its phase, causing its coherence length to shorten exponentially: by a factor
      of two in the second panel, and by a further factor of two in the final one. When the
      packet enters the double slit, its coherence length is on the same order of magnitude
      as the slits' spacing $d$, which will worsen but not entirely eliminate the observability
      of interference fringes.
      (This is only a schematic representation, with the wavepacket shown as being
      many orders of magnitude bigger than its actual size in relation to the vacuum chamber.
      Also, the real experiment used a reflecting grating, not a transmitting double slit.)

      'width'=>'wide',

%>

This causes an effect similar to the one in the situation illustrated in
figure \figref{double-slit-spying-on-one-slit}, where we spy on one slit of a double-slit
apparatus. The microscope would operate by bouncing photons off of the electron, and the result
is to disrupt the coherence of the electron's wavefunction, so that the coherence length is
no longer as large as the distance between the slits. The infrared photons in the Eibenberger
experiment were not introduced intentionally, but they were still bouncing off of the molecules
and producing a similar decrease in the coherence length. This decoherence effect was the reason
that the experiment was limited to molecules of the size they used. Even though the molecules
took only about 400 nanoseconds to fly through the apparatus, there was a significant amount of
decoherence. A larger molecule would have been a bigger target for photons and would have undergone
decoherence more quickly, making interference unobservable.

As in the example of spying on one slit of a double-slit experiment, the question arises of
what has happened to the phase information that appears to have been erased by decoherence,
violating unitarity. The resolution is the same (p.~\pageref{unitarity-phase-randomization}):
the information has flowed out into the environment, but is no longer in a form in which it
is practical to recover it.

Computers and information transmission systems such as the internet are currently implemented
as classical devices. For example, the wavelengths of the electrons that carry signals in a computer
chip are currently orders of magnitude shorter than the size of the logic gates, so that
wave effects such as diffraction and interference are not important (problem \ref{hw:chip-qm},
p.~\pageref{hw:chip-qm}). Even if the current devices such as silicon chips and fiber-optic
cables could simply be scaled down to sizes comparable to the electrons' wavelengths, quantum
effects would at some point simply make them start breaking down or behaving unreliably.

It is possible, however, to design qualitatively different devices in which information and
signals are intentionally manipulated in an explicitly quantum-mechanical fashion. This is
the frontier known as quantum computing. In a quantum computer, the basic unit of information is
not the classical bit but the quantum bit or \emph{qubit}. A qubit can exist in a superposition
of the 0 and 1 states, with a well defined phase, e.g., $\Psi_0+\Psi_1$ is a different state
than $\Psi_0-\Psi_1$ or $\Psi_0+i\Psi_1$. Furthermore, one qubit can have its state entangled
with another's. For example, $\Psi_{01}+\Psi_{10}$ describes a state in which we have two bits,
neither in a definite 0 or 1 state, but which are guaranteed to add up to 1. That is, if one is
true, then the other is guaranteed to be false. It has been shown that some problems that are
hard for classical computers are more tractable for a quantum computer. For example, there is a
known quantum computing algorithm that is capable of efficiently factoring large integers, and when
this is eventually implemented in a practical device, it will have the effect of breaking the
cryptographic algorithms that you currently use for online privacy and security, since the security of those
algorithms is predicated on the assumption that factorization is hard. This would be a disaster for
online economic activity and could have effects such as unmasking political dissidents.

A different application, and one that is easier to explain, is that quantum computing
makes it possible in theory to make copy-proof information. This would not be useful
to Hollywood studios trying to prevent copying of their movies, since the images have
to pass through classical devices anyway in order to be displayed, but it means that one might
be able to send private information through a quantum internet in such a way that it could not be copied
by snoops, even in theory. In contrast, current classical methods of encryption are designed to allow
eavesdropping on an information packet as it hops across the internet, but to make the copy
useless to prying eyes because it cannot be decoded.

The theoretical key to this application of quantum computing is the
counterintuitive \emph{no-cloning theorem},\index{no-cloning theorem}\label{no-cloning-original}
which states that it is
not possible to make a copy of an unknown quantum state.\footnote{The prohibition actually
only applies to making a copy that can be separated from the original. For the complete
statement of this, see p.~\pageref{no-cloning-separable}.}  To see why
this works, suppose that we implement a qubit using the spin 1/2 of a
silver atom, with the convention that the 0 state is represented by
$s_x=-1/2$ and 1 by $s_x=+1/2$.  If you provide me with an atom that
you have prepared, then it might seem straightforward, at least in
principle, for me to copy its state. I can shoot it through a magnetic
spectrometer, as in the Stern-Gerlach experiment, and measure its
$s_x$. Then I prepare another silver atom in the same state. What's
the problem? 

The problem is that if the state of the atom is truly unknown to me, then I have no way of knowing
that it is actually in one of the two states $s_x=-1/2$ and $s_x=+1/2$. It could instead be
in some superposition of these, such as $\Psi_{s_x=-1/2}/\sqrt{2}+i\Psi_{s_x=+1/2}/\sqrt{2}$, with
a 90-degree phase angle between the two components.
Then when I send your atom through the spectrometer, the world becomes one in which both the spectrometer
and my brain are in a superposition of the two states. In one of these worlds, I then go ahead and
prepare my copy-atom in the $s_x=-1/2$ state, and in the other one I set it up as a $+1/2$.
You could say that my copy-atom is, like the original, in a superposition of the two $s_x$ states, but
there is no reason to think that it will be the \emph{same} superposition, with the same 90-degree
phase angle. In fact, by the argument on p.~\pageref{sec:et-phase-randomization} we know
that it is not possible by \emph{any} measurement to extract this phase information and convert it
into classical information. Furthermore, our final result is not really as simple as a copy-atom
in some unknown superposition of the two $s_x$ states. It is a silver atom whose spin is correlated
with the state of the original, but also correlated with the state of the spectrometer and the state
of my brain.

The impossibility of copying an unknown quantum state is enforced by nature in full generality, not
just by the specific mechanisms described in the artificial scenario described above. To see why, consider what
would happen to the state of the ``blank'' atom on which we had hoped to impose the copied state.
Its state would have been overwritten, but this would imply a loss of information, which is forbidden
by the unitarity postulate of quantum mechanics (p.~\pageref{unitarity-postulate}).

The no-cloning theorem would seem to severely limit the practicability of quantum computing.
When you run a program on a classical computer, the very first step to be performed by the operating
system is to copy the program's code and data from storage into random-access memory. If a quantum
computer can't copy anything, then how do we perform this initial step? But the no-cloning theorem doesn't
actually forbid copying \emph{any} quantum state --- it forbids copying an \emph{unknown} state.
Going back to the example of the silver atom, imagine that rather than presenting me with a silver
atom in a completely unknown quantum state, you give me a solemn promise that it will be either
in the state $s_x=-1/2$ or the state $s_x=+1/2$ --- not some superposition of these. Then if you
trace back through the logic of the scenario, you will find that there is absolutely nothing preventing
me from making an accurate copy.

Once the software on a quantum computer starts running, its qubits
will certainly start going into superpositions of the 0 state and the
1 state. By the no-cloning theorem, these cannot be copied from one
memory location to another, overwriting the previous contents of the
target location. But that simply isn't how quantum computing works.
Rather than attempting to copy, erase, and overwrite bits as in a
classical computer, the software is designed to create complicated
correlations between the different bits. This model of computing is
not necessarily better or worse over all than classical digital
computing, but it differs from it as much as an iPhone's model of
computing differs from that of a slide rule.

When a classical computer such as a cash register or phone is done
with its computation, we have to find out the result through an output
such as a paper tape or LCD screen.  These are classical devices. If a
quantum computer is to produce a result for use by humans, then it
will also need to send its output through a classical device.  We
might hope to be able to convert the quantum information faithfully
into classical information. But we can prove based on the no-cloning
theorem that such a conversion will always be ``lossy'' --- will
always involve a degradation of the information. A lossless
conversion, such as a unit conversion, is one that can be done as a
round-trip, e.g., $1\ \munit\rightarrow100\ \zu{cm}\rightarrow1\
\munit$, with the final result being identical to the original.  If we
could completely encode qbits into bits, then we could make a second
copy of the bits and violate no-cloning by converting back to qbits.
This is a contradiction, so we conclude that lossless conversion of
classical information to quantum information is impossible.

\index{entanglement}\index{separability!of a quantum state}

A basic difference between classical computing and quantum computing
is that qubits can be entangled with each other. We've only discussed
entanglement briefly in sec.~\ref{subsec:nonlocality-and-entanglement},
p.~\pageref{subsubsec:entanglement}, where the basic idea was that
either Alice or Bob could detect a certain photon, but not both. Alice
and Bob's states were entangled, as were the macroscopic diamonds in
the 2012 real-world experiment described on
p.~\pageref{macroscopic-entanglement}. More generally, what is
entanglement? 

Entanglement is the opposite of separability (sec.~\ref{subsec:s-eqn-separability}).
To see what is meant by this statement, consider figure \figref{separable}. In
\subfigref{separable}{1}, we have the function $\Psi_1=\sin x\sin 4y$. This could be a two-dimensional
particle in a box, with a certain amount of momentum in the $x$ direction, and four times
that momentum in the $y$ direction. It is because the Schr\"odinger equation for the particle
in a box is separable in $x$ and $y$ that we can write down this wavefunction
by multiplying two different one-dimensional wavefunctions. In figure
\subfigref{separable}{2}, $\Psi_2$ is like $\Psi_1$ but
with $x$ and $y$ interchanged, while \subfigref{separable}{3} shows the superposition
$\Psi_3=(\Psi_1+\Psi_2)/\sqrt2$.

    'separable',

      'width'=>'wide',
      'sidecaption'=>true
    }

From a fancier theoretical point of view, we could say that this
system, which seems like a single thing (the particle), is actually
built out of two subsystems. One subsystem is the motion in the $x$
direction, and the other is the $y$. The fact that the Schr\"odinger
equation is separable can be interpreted as being because the $x$ and
$y$ motion are independent of one another. Exactly the same thing
would happen if this were a classical pool ball on a square table. Its
$x$ and $y$ motion don't affect each other, and, e.g., if the ball
hits the right-hand cushion and has its $x$ momentum reflected, that
doesn't change its $y$ momentum. It's as if the pool ball in two
dimensions were really two different beads, one sliding along a wire
parallel to the $x$ axis and the other sliding up and down. In either
the classical case or the quantum-mechanical case, we have built a
composite system out of two independent subsystems.

In an example like $\Psi_1$, it is possible to assign a definite state to the subsystems:
continuing to ignore units, we can write $p_x=\pm 1$ and $p_y=\pm 4$. The state
with wavefunction $\Psi_2$ has the same energy as $\Psi_1$, and again the subsystems
have a definite state, $p_x=\pm 4$ and $p_y=\pm 1$.

But for the superposition $\Psi_3$, this is no longer true. If we
measure either $p_x$ or $p_y$ for this state, we may get either $\pm1$
or $\pm4$, with equal probability. We say that this state is entangled in the same
way that Alice and Bob were entangled on p.~\pageref{bob-alice-entangled}.
Neither Bob nor Alice is in a definite state of I-saw-a-photon or I-never-saw-a-photon.
However, if we \emph{ask} Bob whether he saw a photon, and he says yes, then
we gain information about Alice: that she didn't see a photon. Similarly, if we
measure $p_x$ for the particle in state $\Psi_3$ and get $-4$, then we gain information
about $p_y$: we know that it is $\pm1$.

Because separable states are the simplest things we can make by putting together subsystems
like legos, it's convenient to have a notation for them. In the angle-bracket notation, 
all of the following are possible ways that people might notate a state like $\Psi_1$:
\begin{equation*}
  |1,4\rangle \qquad\text{or}\qquad
  |1\rangle |4\rangle  \qquad\text{or}\qquad
  |1\rangle \otimes |4\rangle
\end{equation*}
The cross with a circle around it, $\otimes$, doesn't really indicate multiplication. It's more
like a punctuation mark or a conjunction, meaning ``and also,'' as in, ``I'll have the eggplant, and
also a beer.'' It's called a tensor product, which makes it sound scary.\index{tensor product!of quantum states}

To show the generality of the idea of entanglement, let's consider an example from particle physics.
The $\pi^0$ is a particle that participates in strong nuclear interactions, and therefore
can be created in nuclear reactions. It's known as a pion. There are other types of pions.
The $\pi^0$ is the only electrically neutral one, hence the superscript 0. All pions are
unstable, which is why we need to create them in  reactions rather than looking for them
in rocks and trees. The $\pi^0$ has a half-life of only $10^{-16}\ \sunit$, and one of the
ways in which it can decay is into an electron and a positron (antielectron),
\begin{equation*}
  \pi^0 \rightarrow e^- + e^+.
\end{equation*}
You can verify that charge is conserved in this reaction. In the frame of reference where
the pion is initially at rest, the speeds of the electron and positron are fixed by
conservation of energy and momentum, so there is not much that is interesting to measure
about them other than their spins. The pion has zero spin, which makes it somewhat unusual
in the world of particle physics. If we assume as well, for simplicity, that
the electron and positron don't have any orbital angular momentum, then
by conservation of angular momentum, the spin-1/2 of the electron must be in the opposite
direction compared to that of the positron. 

The electron and positron fly off in opposite directions due to
conservation of momentum, and they could be detected by two different
particle detectors lying at macroscopic distances from the place where
the decay happened, as in figure \figref{pion-decay-entanglement}.
Although separated, they are entangled. Suppose each of the detectors is
capable of detecting the component of the spin along a $z$ axis that
is defined by the orientation of the detector itself. For example, the
detector could in principle be a Stern-Gerlach spectrometer
(sec.~\ref{sec:stern-gerlach}, p.~\pageref{sec:stern-gerlach}),
although in practice some other, more efficient method would be used.
If one detector measures $s_z=+1/2$, then the other is guaranteed to see $s_z=-1/2$,
because anything else would violate conservation of angular momentum. That is, the
wavefunction of the system is of the form
\begin{equation*}
  \Psi = c|\uparrow\downarrow\rangle + c'|\downarrow\uparrow\rangle,
\end{equation*}
where normalization requires that $c^2+c'^2=1$. If we had some way to point the
pion in a certain direction before it decayed, or produce it so that it was pointed
in a certain direction, then perhaps we could have arranged things so that
one of the two possibilities, say $|\uparrow\downarrow\rangle$, was more likely.
But the pion has spin 0, and a spinless particle is like a perfectly smooth and featureless
ping-pong ball; there is no way to impose, define, or measure an orientation for it.
Therefore by symmetry we have $c^2=c'^2$. For example, we could have
$c$ and $c'$ both equal to $1/\sqrt{2}$, or $c=i/\sqrt{2}$ and $c'=-1/\sqrt{2}$.
The states $|\uparrow\downarrow\rangle$ and $|\downarrow\uparrow\rangle$ are separable
in terms of the two spins, but $\Psi$ is entangled. In the state $\Psi$, neither spin
has a definite value, but measuring one spin determines the other spin.

In quantum computing, once a quantum computer has started running, all of its qbits will
in general be entangled with one another. That means that if we read out one qbit,
then later read-outs of other qbits will have results that are correlated with what
we got when we read out the first one. With classical information, we can always
do things like splitting a book up into chapters, or distributing a long movie on
two DVDs. That doesn't always work for a quantum computer. It \emph{might} work if
part of the data was separable from another part, but we would need a computer
program to scan through the data and figure out whether this was in fact possible.
This is called the separability problem, and unfortunately it is known to be intractable.

The no-cloning theorem\index{no-cloning theorem}\label{no-cloning-separable}
described on p.~\pageref{no-cloning-original} is only a prohibition on making
a \emph{separable} copy of an unknown state. To see why, consider an experiment
like the one in figure \figref{pion-decay-paradox}, in which we set up the detectors
so that their spin-detecting axes are in perpendicular orientations. Say one detector
measures the spin of the electron along the $x$ axis, while the other measures the
positron's $z$ spin. Now it seems that we can infer simultaneous values of both $L_x$ and $L_z$
for each particle, but that is impossible because
$L_x$ and $L_z$ are incompatible observables (p.~\pageref{proof-lx-and-lz-incompatible}).
Well, suppose that we measure the electron's $L_x$ first, and then the positron's $L_z$.
This is actually equivalent to measuring $-L_x$ for the the \emph{positron}, and then
$L_z$ for the positron. No paradox arises, because one of the measurements will inevitably
have changed the positron's spin. Going back to the version of the experiment using the entangled
electron and positron, the same thing happens. For example, measuring the electron's spin
has the ability to change the \emph{positron's} spin, because they're entangled.
The no-cloning theorem cannot possibly prohibit making
\emph{entangled} copies, because then it would forbid entanglement itself. 
Only making \emph{separable} copies inevitably leads to paradoxes.
