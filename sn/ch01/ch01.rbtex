        Change is impossible, claimed the ancient Greek philosopher 
        Parmenides.\index{Parmenides} 
        His work was nonscientific, since he didn't state his ideas in a form that
        would allow them to be tested experimentally, but modern science nevertheless
        has a strong Parmenidean flavor. His main argument that change is an illusion
        was that something can't be turned into nothing, and likewise if you have nothing, you can't
        turn it into something. To make this into a scientific theory, we have to decide on
        a way to measure what ``something'' is, and we can then check by measurements
        whether the total amount of ``something'' in the universe really stays constant.
        How much ``something'' is there in a rock? Does a sunbeam count as ``something?''
        Does heat count? Motion? Thoughts and feelings?

If you look at the table of contents of this book, you'll see that the first
four chapters have the word ``conservation'' in them.
In physics, a conservation law\index{conservation law} 
is a statement that the total amount of a certain physical quantity always stays the
same. This chapter is about conservation of mass.\index{mass!conservation of} 
 The metric system\index{metric system} is designed around a unit of distance,
the meter,\index{meter (unit)} a unit of mass, the kilogram,\index{kilogram}  and a time unit, the
second.\index{second (unit)} Numerical measurement of distance and time probably date back almost
as far into prehistory as counting money, but mass is a more modern concept. Until
scientists figured out that mass was conserved, it wasn't obvious that there could be
a single, consistent way of measuring an amount of matter, hence jiggers of whiskey
and cords of wood. You may wonder why conservation of mass wasn't discovered
until relatively modern times, but it wasn't obvious, for example, that gases had
mass, and that the apparent loss of mass when wood was burned was exactly
matched by the mass of the escaping gases.

Once scientists were on the track of
the conservation of mass concept, they began looking for a way to define mass
in terms of a definite measuring procedure. If they tried such a procedure, and the
result was that it led to nonconservation of mass, then they would throw it out and
try a different procedure. For instance, we might be tempted to define mass using
kitchen measuring cups, i.e., as a measure of volume. Mass would then be perfectly
conserved for a process like mixing marbles with peanut butter, but there would be
processes like freezing water that led to a net increase in mass, and others like soaking
up water with a sponge that caused a decrease. If, with the benefit of hindsight, it seems
like the measuring cup definition was just plain silly, then here's a more subtle example
of a wrong definition of mass. Suppose we define it using a bathroom scale, or a more
precise device such as a postal scale that works on the same principle of using
gravity to compress or twist a spring. The trouble
is that gravity is not equally strong all over the surface of the earth, so 
for instance there would
be nonconservation of mass when you brought an object up to the top of a mountain,
where gravity is a little weaker.

Although some of the obvious possibilities have problems, there do turn out to be at least two approaches to defining mass that lead to its being
a conserved quantity, so we consider these definitions to be ``right'' in the pragmatic
sense that what's correct is what's useful.

One definition that works is to use balances, but compensate for the local strength of gravity.
This is the method that is used by scientists
who actually specialize in ultraprecise measurements. A standard
kilogram,\index{kilogram!standard} in the form
of a platinum-iridium cylinder, is kept in a special shrine in Paris. Copies are made that
balance against the standard kilogram in Parisian gravity, and they are
then transported to laboratories in
other parts of the world, where they are compared with other masses in the local
gravity. The quantity defined in this way is
called \emph{gravitational mass}.\index{mass!gravitational}

\enlargethispage{-\baselineskip}

A second and completely different approach is to measure how hard it is to
change an object's state of motion. This
tells us its \emph{inertial mass}.\index{mass!inertial}
For example, I'd be more willing to stand in the way of an oncoming poodle
than in the path of a freight train,
because my body will have a harder time convincing the freight train to stop.
This is a dictionary-style conceptual definition,\index{definitions!conceptual}
but in physics we need to back
up a conceptual definition with an operational definition,\index{definitions!operational}
which is one that spells
out the operations required in order to measure the quantity being defined.
We can operationalize our definition of inertial mass by
throwing a standard kilogram at an object
at a speed of 1 m/s (one meter per second) and measuring the recoiling object's
velocity. Suppose we want to measure the mass of a particular
block of cement. We put the block in a toy wagon on the sidewalk, and throw
a standard kilogram at it. Suppose the standard kilogram hits the wagon,
and then drops straight
down to the sidewalk, having lost all its velocity, and the wagon and the block inside
recoil at a velocity of 0.23 m/s. We then repeat the experiment with the block
replaced by various numbers of standard kilograms, and find that we can reproduce
the recoil velocity of 0.23 m/s with four standard kilograms in the wagon. We have
determined the mass of the block to be four kilograms.\footnote{You might think intuitively
that the recoil velocity should be exactly one fourth of a meter per second, and
you'd be right except that the wagon has some mass as well. Our present approach, however,
only requires that we give a way to test for equality of masses. To predict the recoil
velocity from scratch, we'd need to use conservation of momentum, which is discussed
in a later chapter.} Although this
definition of inertial mass has an appealing conceptual simplicity, it is obviously
not very practical, at least in this crude form. Nevertheless, this method of collision is very
much like the methods used for measuring the masses of
subatomic particles, which, after all, can't be put on little postal scales!

Astronauts spending long periods
of time in space need to monitor their loss of bone and muscle mass, and here as well,
it's impossible to measure gravitational mass. Since they don't want to have standard
kilograms thrown at them, they use a slightly different technique 
(figures \figref{mass_on_spring} and \figref{bodymass}).
They strap themselves
to a chair which is attached to a large spring, and measure the time it takes for one
cycle of vibration.

<% begin_sec("Problem-solving techniques") %>

How do we use a conservation law, such as conservation of mass, to solve problems?
There are two basic techniques.

As an analogy, consider conservation of money,
which makes it illegal for you to create dollar bills using your
own inkjet printer. (Most people don't intentionally destroy their dollar bills, either!)
Suppose the police notice that a particular store doesn't seem to have any customers,
but the owner wears lots of gold jewelry and drives a BMW. They suspect that the store
is a front for some kind of crime, perhaps counterfeiting. With intensive surveillance,
there are two basic approaches they could use in their investigation. One method would
be to have undercover agents try to find out how much money goes in the door, and how
much money comes back out at the end of the day, perhaps by arranging through some
trick to get access to the owner's briefcase in the morning and evening. If the amount
of money that comes out every day is greater than the amount that went in, and if
they're convinced there is no safe on the premises holding a large reservoir of money,
then the owner must be counterfeiting.
This inflow-equals-outflow technique is useful if we are sure that there is a region of
space within which there is no supply of mass that is being built up or depleted.

\begin{eg}{A stream of water}\label{eg:faucet}
If you watch water flowing out of the end of a hose,
you'll see that the stream
of water is fatter near the mouth of the hose, and skinnier lower down. This is because the
water speeds up as it falls. If the cross-sectional area of the stream was equal all along
its length, then the rate of flow (kilograms per second) through a lower cross-section
would be greater than the rate of flow through a cross-section higher up. Since the flow
is steady, the amount of water between the two cross-sections stays constant. Conservation
of mass therefore requires that the cross-sectional area of the stream shrink in inverse
proportion to the increasing speed of the falling water.

How can we apply a conservation law, such as conservation of mass, 
in a situation where mass might be stored up somewhere?
To use a crime analogy again, a prison could contain a certain number of prisoners,
who are not allowed to flow in or out at will. In physics, this is known
as a \emph{closed system}\index{system!closed}\index{closed system}.
A guard might notice that a certain
prisoner's cell is empty, but that doesn't mean he's escaped. He could be sick
in the infirmary, or hard at work in the shop 
earning cigarette money. What prisons actually do
is to count all their prisoners every day, and make sure today's total is the same
as yesterday's. One way of stating a conservation law is that for a closed system,
the total amount of stuff (mass, in this chapter) stays constant.

\begin{eg}{Lavoisier and chemical reactions in a closed system}
The French chemist
Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier\index{Lavoisier, Pierre-Andr\'e!conservation of mass}
is considered the inventor of
the concept of conservation of mass. Before Lavoisier, chemists had never systematically
weighed their chemicals to quantify the amount of each substance that was undergoing
reactions. They also didn't completely understand that gases were just another
state of matter, and hadn't tried performing reactions in sealed chambers to determine
whether gases were being consumed from or released into the air. For this they had at least one
practical excuse, which is that if you perform a gas-releasing reaction in a sealed chamber
with no room for expansion, you get an explosion! Lavoisier invented a balance that was capable
of measuring milligram masses, and figured out how to do reactions in an upside-down
bowl in a basin of water, so that the gases could expand by pushing out some of the water.
In a crucial experiment, Lavoisier heated a red mercury compound, which we would now
describe as mercury oxide (HgO), in such a sealed chamber.
A gas was produced (Lavoisier later named
it ``oxygen''), driving out some of the water, and the red compound was transformed into
silvery liquid mercury metal. The crucial point was that the total mass of the entire
apparatus was exactly the same before and after the reaction. Based on many observations
of this type, Lavoisier proposed a general law of nature, that mass is always conserved.
(In earlier experiments, in which closed systems were not used, chemists had become
convinced that there was a mysterious substance, phlogiston, involved in
combustion and oxidation
reactions, and that phlogiston's mass could be positive, negative, or zero depending on
the situation!)

<% begin_sec("Delta notation") %>

A convenient notation used throughout physics is $\Delta$, the uppercase Greek
letter delta, which indicates ``change in'' or ``after minus before.'' For example,
if $b$ represents how much money you have in the bank, then a deposit of
\$100 could be represented as $\Delta{}b=\$100$. That is, the change in your
balance was \$100, or the balance after the transaction minus the balance before
the transaction equals \$100. A withdrawal would be indicated by $\Delta{}b<0$.
We represent ``before'' and ``after'' using the subscripts $i$ (initial) and
$f$ (final), e.g., $\Delta{}b=b_f-b_i$. Often the delta notation allows more precision
than English words. For instance, ``time'' can be used to mean a point in time
(``now's the time''), $t$, or it could mean a period of time
(``the whole time, he had spit on his chin''), $\Delta{}t$.

This notation is particularly convenient for discussing conserved quantities.
The law of conservation of mass can be stated simply as $\Delta{}m=0$,
where $m$ is the total mass of any closed system.

\label{gravinersection}
        We find experimentally that both gravitational and inertial mass are conserved to a
        high degree of precision for a great number of processes, including chemical
        reactions, melting, boiling, soaking up water with a sponge, and rotting of meat
        and vegetables.  Now it's logically possible that both gravitational and inertial mass
        are conserved, but that there is no particular relationship between them, in which case
        we would say that they are separately conserved. On the other hand, the two
        conservation laws may be redundant,
        like having one law against murder and another law against killing people!

Here's an experiment that gets at the issue: stand up now and
drop a coin and one of your shoes side by
side. I used a 400-gram shoe and a 2-gram penny, and they hit the floor at
the same time as far as I could tell by eye. This is an interesting result, but
a physicist and an ordinary person will find it interesting for different
reasons.

The layperson is surprised, since it would seem logical that heaver objects
would always fall faster than light ones. However,
it's fairly easy to prove that if air friction is negligible, any two objects
made of the same substance must have identical motion when they fall. For
instance, a 2-kg copper mass must exhibit the same falling motion as a 1-kg
copper mass, because nothing would be changed by physically joining
together two 1-kg copper masses to make a single 2-kg copper mass. Suppose,
for example, that they are joined with a dab of glue; the glue isn't under any
strain, because the two masses are doing the same thing side by side. Since the
glue isn't really doing anything, it makes no difference whether the masses fall
separately or side by side.\footnote{The argument only fails for objects light enough to
be affected appreciably by air friction: a bunch of feathers falls differently if
you wad them up because the pattern of air flow is altered by putting them
together.}

What a physicist finds remarkable about the shoe-and-penny experiment is that 
it came out the way it did even though the shoe and the penny are made of
\emph{different} substances. There is absolutely no theoretical reason why this
should be true. We could say that it happens because the greater gravitational
mass of the shoe is exactly counteracted by its greater inertial mass, which
makes it harder for gravity to get it moving, but that just leaves us wondering
why inertial mass and gravitational mass are always in proportion to each
other. It's possible that they are
only approximately equivalent. Most of the mass of ordinary matter comes
from neutrons and protons, and we could imagine, for instance,
that neutrons and protons do not
have exactly the same ratio of gravitational to inertial mass. This would show
up as a different ratio of gravitational to inertial mass for substances containing
different proportions of neutrons and protons.

Galileo\index{Galileo!inertial and gravitational mass} did the first numerical
experiments on this issue in the seventeenth century by rolling balls down
inclined planes, although he didn't think about his results in these terms. A fairly
easy way to improve on Galileo's accuracy is to use pendulums with bobs
made of different materials. Suppose, for example, that we construct an
aluminum bob and a brass bob, and use a double-pan balance to verify to
good precision that their gravitational masses are equal. If we then measure
the time required for each pendulum to perform a hundred cycles, we can
check whether the results are the same. If their inertial masses are unequal,
then the one with a smaller inertial mass will go through each cycle faster,
since gravity has an easier time accelerating and decelerating it. With this
type of experiment, one can easily verify that gravitational and inertial mass
are proportional to each other to an accuracy of $10^{-3}$ or $10^{-4}$.

In 1889, the Hungarian physicist Roland E\"otv\"os\index{E\"otv\"os, Roland}
used a slightly different approach to verify the equivalence        of gravitational and inertial mass for various
substances to an accuracy of about $10^{-8}$, and the best such
experiment, figure \figref{braginskii},
improved on even this phenomenal accuracy, bringing it to the $10^{-12}$         level.\footnote{V.B. Braginskii and V.I. Panov, Soviet Physics JETP 34, 463 (1972).}
In all the experiments described so far, the two objects move along similar
trajectories: straight lines in the penny-and-shoe and inclined plane
experiments, and circular arcs in the pendulum version. The
E\"otv\"os-style experiment looks for differences in the objects' trajectories.
The concept can be understood by imagining
the following simplified version. Suppose, as in figure \figref{roll},
 we roll a brass cylinder off of a tabletop
and measure where it hits the floor, and then do the same with an aluminum
cylinder, making sure that both of them go over the edge with precisely the
same velocity. An object with zero gravitational mass would fly off straight
and hit the wall, while an object with zero inertial mass would make a sudden
90-degree turn and drop straight to the floor. If the aluminum and brass cylinders
have ordinary, but slightly unequal, ratios of gravitational to inertial mass, then
they will follow trajectories that are just slightly different. In other words, if
inertial and gravitational mass are not exactly proportional to each other for
all substances, then objects made of different substances will have different
trajectories in the presence of gravity.

A simplified drawing of a practical, high-precision experiment is shown in figure
\figref{eotvos}. Two objects made of different substances are
balanced on the ends of a bar, which is suspended at the
center from a thin fiber. The whole apparatus moves
through space on a complicated, looping trajectory arising from the rotation of the earth
superimposed on the earth's orbital motion around the sun. Both the earth's gravity
and the sun's gravity act on the two objects. If their inertial masses are
not exactly in proportion to their gravitational masses, then they will follow slightly
different trajectories through space, which will result in a very slight twisting
of the fiber between the daytime, when the sun's gravity is pulling upward,
and the night, when the sun's gravity is downward. Figure \figref{braginskii}
shows a more realistic picture of the apparatus.

This type of experiment, in which one expects a null result, is a tough way to
make a career as a scientist. If your measurement comes out as expected, but with
better accuracy than other people had previously achieved, your result is publishable,
but won't be considered earthshattering. On the other hand, if you build the most
sensitive experiment ever, and the result comes out contrary to expectations, you're
in a scary situation. You could be right, and earn a place in history, but if the result
turns out to be due to a defect in your experiment, then you've made a fool of yourself.

I defined inertial mass conceptually as a measure of how hard it is to
\emph{change} an object's state of motion, the implication being that if you
don't interfere, the object's motion won't change. Most people, however, believe
that objects in motion have a natural tendency to slow down. Suppose I push my
refrigerator to the west for a while at 0.1 m/s, and then stop pushing. The average
person would say fridge just naturally stopped moving, but let's imagine how
someone in China would describe the fridge experiment carried out in my house here
in California. Due to the rotation of the earth, California is moving to the east
at about 400 m/s. A point in China at the same latitude has the same speed,
but since China is on the other side of the planet, China's east is my west. (If you're
finding the three-dimensional visualization difficult, just think of China and
California
as two freight trains that go past each other, each traveling at 400 m/s.)
If I insist on thinking of my dirt as being stationary, then China and its dirt are moving
at 800 m/s to my west. From China's point of view, however, it's California that is
moving 800 m/s in the opposite direction (my east). When I'm pushing the fridge
to the west at 0.1 m/s, the observer in China describes its speed as 799.9 m/s.
Once I stop pushing, the fridge speeds back up to 800 m/s. From my point of view,
the fridge ``naturally'' slowed down when I stopped
pushing, but according to the
observer in China, it ``naturally'' sped up!

What's really happening here is that there's a tendency, due to friction,
for the fridge to stop moving \emph{relative to the floor}.
In general, only relative motion has physical
significance in physics, not absolute motion. It's not even possible to define
absolute motion, since there is no special reference point in the universe that
everyone can agree is at rest. Of course if we want to measure motion, we do have
to pick some arbitrary reference point which we will say is standing still, and we
can then define $x$, $y$, and $z$ coordinates extending out from that point,
which we can define as having $x=0$, $y=0$, $z=0$. Setting up such a system
is known as choosing a
\emph{frame of reference}.\index{frame of reference} The local dirt
is a natural frame of reference for describing a game of basketball, but if the game
was taking place on the deck of a moving ocean liner, we would probably pick a frame
of reference in which the deck was at rest, and the land was moving.

Galileo was the first scientist to reason along these lines, and we now use
the term Galilean relativity to refer to a somewhat modernized
version of his principle. Roughly speaking, the principle of Galilean relativity states that the
same laws of physics apply in any frame of reference that is moving in a straight
line at constant speed. We need to refine this statement, however, since it is
not necessarily obvious which frames of reference are going in a straight line at
constant speed. A person in a pickup truck pulling away from a stoplight could admit that the
car's velocity is changing, or she could insist that the truck is at rest, and the
meter on the dashboard is going up because the asphalt picked that moment to start
moving faster and faster backward! Frames of reference are not all created equal,
however, and the accelerating truck's frame of reference is not as good as the
asphalt's. We can tell, because a bowling ball in the back of the truck, as in figure \figref{truck}, appears to
behave strangely in the driver's frame of reference: in her rear-view mirror, she
sees the ball, initially at rest, start moving faster and faster toward the back of
the truck. This goofy behavior is evidence that there is something wrong with her
frame of reference. A person on the sidewalk, however, sees the ball as standing still.
In the sidewalk's frame of reference, the truck pulls away from the ball, and this
makes sense, because the truck is burning gas and using up energy to change its state
of motion.

We therefore define an \emph{inertial frame of
reference}\index{frame of reference!inertial}\index{inertial frame of reference}
as one in which we never see objects change their state of
motion without any apparent reason. The sidewalk is a pretty good inertial frame, and
a car moving relative to the sidewalk at constant speed in a straight line defines
a pretty good inertial frame, but a car that is accelerating or turning is not
a inertial frame.

The principle of Galilean relativity states that inertial frames exist, and that
the same laws of physics apply in all inertial frames of reference, regardless
of one frame's straight-line, constant-speed motion relative to another.\footnote{The
principle of Galilean relativity is extended on
page \pageref{subsec:rotationalinvariance}.}

Another way of putting it is that all inertial frames are created equal. We can
say whether one inertial frame is in motion or at rest relative to another, but there is
no privileged ``rest frame.'' There is no experiment that comes out any different
in laboratories in different inertial frames, so there is no experiment that
could tell us which inertial frame is really, truly at rest.

\begin{eg}{The speed of sound}
\egquestion
The speed of sound in air is only 340 m/s, so unless you live
at a near-polar latitude, you're moving at greater than the speed of sound right now
due to the Earth's rotation. In that case, why don't we experience exciting phenomena
like sonic booms all the time?
\eganswer
It might seem as though you're unprepared to deal with this question
right now, since the only law of physics you know is conservation of mass, and
conservation of mass doesn't tell you anything obviously useful about the speed of
sound or sonic booms. Galilean relativity, however, is a blanket statement about
all the laws of physics, so in a situation like this, it may let you predict the
results of the laws of physics without actually knowing what all the laws are!
If the laws of physics predict a certain value for the speed of sound, then they
had better predict the speed of the sound relative to the air, not their speed
relative to some special ``rest frame.'' Since the air is moving along with the
rotation of the earth, we don't detect any special phenomena. To get a sonic
boom, the source of the sound would have to be moving relative to the air.

\begin{eg}{The Foucault pendulum}
Note that in the example of the bowling ball in the truck, I didn't claim the
sidewalk was \emph{exactly} a Galilean frame
of reference. This is because the sidewalk is moving in a circle due to the rotation
of the Earth, and is therefore changing the direction of its motion continuously
on a 24-hour cycle. However, the curve of the motion is so gentle that under
ordinary conditions we don't notice that the local dirt's frame of reference isn't
quite inertial. The first demonstration of the noninertial nature of the earth-fixed
frame of reference was by Foucault\index{Foucault}
 using a very massive pendulum (figure \figref{foucault}) whose oscillations
would persist for many hours without becoming imperceptible. Although Foucault did
his demonstration in Paris, it's easier to imagine what would happen at the north pole:
the pendulum would keep swinging in the same plane, but the earth would spin underneath
it once every 24 hours. To someone standing in the snow, it would appear that the
pendulum's plane of motion was twisting. The effect at latitudes less than 90
degrees turns out to be slower, but otherwise similar. The Foucault pendulum was
the first definitive experimental proof that the earth really did spin on its axis,
although scientists had been convinced of its rotation for a century based on more
indirect evidence about the structure of the solar system.

Although popular belief has Galileo being prosecuted
by the Catholic Church for saying the earth rotated on its axis and also orbited the sun,
Foucault's pendulum was still centuries in the future, so Galileo had no hard
proof; Galileo's insights into relative versus absolute motion simply made it
more plausible that the world could be spinning without producing dramatic effects,
but didn't disprove the contrary hypothesis that the sun, moon, and
stars went around the earth every 24 hours. Furthermore, the Church was much more
liberal and enlightened than most people believe. It didn't (and still doesn't)
require a literal interpretation of the Bible, and one of the Church officials
involved in the Galileo affair wrote that ``the Bible tells us how to go to heaven,
not how the heavens go.'' In other words, religion and science should be separate.
The actual reason Galileo got in trouble is shrouded in mystery, since Italy in the
age of the Medicis was a secretive place where unscrupulous people might settle a score
with poison or a false accusation of heresy. What is certain is that Galileo's
satirical style of scientific writing made many enemies among the powerful Jesuit scholars
who were his intellectual opponents --- he compared one to a snake that doesn't know
its own back is broken. It's also possible that the Church was far less upset by his
astronomical work than by his support for atomism\index{atoms}
 (discussed further in the next section). Some theologians perceived atomism
as contradicting transubstantiation, the Church's doctrine that
the holy bread and wine were literally transformed into the flesh and blood of
Christ by the priest's blessing.

<% begin_sec("Applications of calculus") %>

Let's see how this relates to calculus. If an object is moving in one dimension,
we can describe its position with a function $x(t)$. The derivative
$v=\der{}x/\der{}t$ is called the velocity, and the second derivative
$a=\der{}v/\der{}t=\der{}^2x/\der{}t^2$ is the acceleration.\index{acceleration} Galilean relativity
tells us that there is no detectable effect due to an object's absolute
velocity, since in some other frame of reference, the object's velocity might be
zero. However, an acceleration does have physical consequences.

Observers in different inertial frames of reference will disagree on velocities, but
agree on accelerations. Let's keep it simple by continuing to work in one dimension.
One frame of reference uses a coordinate system $x_1$, and the other we label
$x_2$. If the positive $x_1$ and $x_2$ axes point in the same direction, then in
general two inertial frames could be related by an equation of the form
$x_2=x_1+b+ut$, where $u$ is the constant velocity of one frame relative to the
other, and the constant $b$ tells us how far apart the origins of the two coordinate
systems were at $t=0$. The velocities are different in the two frames of reference:
\begin{equation*}
     \frac{\der x_2}{\der t} = \frac{\der x_1}{\der t} + u\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
Suppose, for example, frame 1 is defined from the sidewalk, and frame 2 
is fixed to a float in a parade that is moving to our left at a velocity
$u=1\ \munit/\sunit$. A dog that is moving to the right with a velocity
$v_1=\der{}x_1/\der{}t=3\ \munit/\sunit$ in the sidewalk's frame will appear to be moving
at a velocity of $v_2=\der x_2/\der t=\der x_1/\der t+u=4\ \munit/\sunit$ in the float's frame.

For acceleration, however, we have
\begin{equation*}
     \frac{\der^2 x_2}{\der t^2} = \frac{\der^2 x_1}{\der t^2}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
since the derivative of the constant $u$ is zero. Thus an acceleration, unlike
a velocity, can have
a definite physical significance to all
observers in all frames of reference. If this
wasn't true, then there would be no particular reason to define a quantity
called acceleration in the first place.

``Mommy, why do you and Daddy have to go to work?'' ``To make money, sweetie-pie.''
``Why do we need money?'' ``To buy food.'' ``Why does food cost money?''
When small children ask a chain of ``why'' questions like this, it usually isn't
too long before their parents end up saying something like, ``Because that's
just the way it is,'' or, more honestly, ``I don't know the answer.''

The same happens in physics. We may gradually learn to explain things more and more
deeply, but there's always the possibility that a certain observed fact, such as
conservation of mass, will never be understood on any deeper level. Science,
after all, uses limited methods to achieve limited goals, so the ultimate
reason for all existence will always be the province of religion. There is,
however, an appealing explanation for conservation of mass, which is atomism,\index{atoms}
the theory that matter is made of tiny, unchanging particles. The atomic
hypothesis dates back to ancient Greece, but the first solid evidence to support
it didn't come until around the eighteenth century, and individual atoms were never
detected until about 1900. The atomic theory implies not only conservation of mass,
but a couple of other things as well.

First, it implies that the total mass of one particular
element is conserved. For instance, lead and gold are both elements, and if we
assume that lead atoms can't be turned into gold atoms, then the total mass of
lead and the total mass of gold are separately conserved. It's as though there was
not just a law against pickpocketing, but also a law against surreptitiously
moving money from one of the victim's pockets to the other. It turns out, however,
that although chemical reactions\index{chemical reactions}\index{reactions!chemical}
 never change one type of atom into another,
transmutation can happen in nuclear reactions,\index{nuclear reactions}\index{reactions!nuclear}
 such as the ones that created most
of the elements in your body out of the primordial hydrogen and helium that
condensed out of the aftermath of the Big Bang.\index{Big Bang}

Second, atomism implies that mass is \emph{quantized}, meaning that only certain values
of mass are possible and the ones in between can't
exist.\index{quantization!of mass}\index{mass!quantization of} 
We can have three atoms of gold or four atoms of gold, but not three an a half.
Although quantization of mass is a natural
consequence of any theory in which matter is made up of tiny particles, it
was discovered in the twentieth century that other quantities, such as energy,
are quantized as well, which had previously not been suspected.

If atomism is starting to make conservation of mass seem inevitable to you,
then it may disturb you to know that Einstein discovered it isn't really
conserved. If you put a 50-gram iron nail in some water, seal the whole
thing up, and let it sit on a fantastically precise balance while the nail
rusts, you'll find that the system loses about $6\times10^{-12}$ kg of mass
by the time the nail has turned completely to rust. This has to do with
Einstein's famous equation $E=mc^2$. Rusting releases heat energy, which
then escapes out into the room. Einstein's equation states that this amount
of heat, $E$, is equivalent to a certain amount of mass, $m$. The $c$ in the
$c^2$ is the speed of light, which is a large number, and a large amount of
energy is therefore equivalent to a very small amount of mass, so you don't
notice nonconservation of mass under ordinary conditions. What is really
conserved is not the mass, $m$, but the mass-plus-energy, $E+mc^2$. The point
of this discussion is not to get you to do numerical exercises with
$E=mc^2$ (at this point you don't even know what units are used to
measure energy),
but simply to point out to you the empirical nature of the laws
of physics. If a previously accepted theory is contradicted by
an experiment, then the theory needs to be changed. This is also a good
example of something called the
\emph{correspondence principle}\index{correspondence principle},
which is a historical observation about how scientific theories change:
when a new scientific theory
replaces an old one, the old theory is always contained within the new
one as an approximation that works within a certain restricted range of
situations. Conservation of mass is an extremely good approximation for
all chemical reactions, since chemical reactions never release or consume
enough energy to change the total mass by a large percentage. Conservation
of mass would not have been accepted for 110 years as a fundamental principle
of physics if it hadn't been verified over and over again by a huge number
of accurate experiments.
