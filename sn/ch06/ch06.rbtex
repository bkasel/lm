Dandelion. Cello. Read those two words, and your brain instantly
conjures a stream of associations, the most prominent of which have to
do with vibrations. Our mental category of ``dandelion-ness'' is strongly
linked to the color of light waves that vibrate about half a million
billion times a second: yellow. The velvety throb of a cello has as its
most obvious characteristic a relatively low musical pitch --- the note
you're spontaneously imagining right now might be one whose sound
vibrations repeat at a rate of a hundred times a second.

Evolution seems to have
designed our two most important senses around the assumption that our
environment is made of waves, whereas
up until now, we've mostly taken the view that Nature can be understood
by breaking her down into smaller and smaller parts, ending up with
particles as her most fundamental building blocks. Does that work
for light and sound? Sound waves are disturbances in air, which is made
of atoms, but light, on the other hand,
 isn't a vibration of atoms. Light, unlike sound, can travel through
a vacuum: if you're reading this by sunlight, you're taking advantage of
light that had to make it through
millions of miles of vacuum to get to you. Waves, then, are not just a trick
that vibrating atoms can do. Waves are one of the basic phenomena
of the universe. At the end of this book, we'll even see that the things
we've been calling particles, such as electrons, are really waves!\footnote{Speaking
more carefully, I should say that every basic building block of light and matter
has both wave and particle properties.}

Let's start with an intuition-building exercise that deals with waves in
matter, since they're easier than light waves to get your hands on. Put your
fingertip in the middle of a cup of water and then remove it
suddenly. You'll have noticed two results that are
surprising to most people. First, the flat surface of the
water does not simply sink uniformly to fill in the volume
vacated by your finger. Instead, ripples spread out, and the
process of flattening out occurs over a long period of time,
during which the water at the center vibrates above and
below the normal water level. This type of wave motion is
the topic of the present section.  Second, you've found
that the ripples bounce off of the walls of the cup, in much
the same way that a ball would bounce off of a wall. In the
next section we discuss what happens to waves that have a
boundary around them. Until then, we confine ourselves to
wave phenomena that can be analyzed as if the medium (e.g.,
the water) was infinite and the same everywhere.

It isn't hard to understand why removing your fingertip
creates ripples rather than simply allowing the water to
sink back down uniformly. The initial crater, \figref{finger-in-cup}/1, left
behind by your finger has sloping sides, and the water next
to the crater flows downhill to fill in the hole. The water
far away, on the other hand, initially has no way of knowing
what has happened, because there is no slope for it to flow
down. As the hole fills up, the rising water at the center
gains upward momentum, and overshoots, creating a little
hill where there had been a hole originally. The area just
outside of this region has been robbed of some of its water
in order to build the hill, so a depressed ``moat'' is
formed, \figref{finger-in-cup}/2. This effect cascades outward, producing
ripples.

There are three main ways in which wave motion differs from
the motion of objects made of matter.

\index{waves!superposition of}\index{superposition!of waves}
If you watched the water in the cup carefully, you noticed the
ghostlike behavior of the
reflected ripples coming back toward the center of the cup and
the outgoing ripples that hadn't yet been reflected: they passed
right through each other.
This is the first, and the most profound, difference between wave motion
and the motion of objects: waves do not display any
repulsion of each other analogous to the normal forces
between objects that come in contact. Two wave patterns can
therefore overlap in the same region of space, as shown in
figure \figref{toes-in-pool}. Where the two waves
coincide, they add together. For instance, suppose that at a
certain location in at a certain moment in time, each wave
would have had a crest 3 cm above the normal water level.
The waves combine at this point to make a 6-cm crest. We use
negative numbers to represent depressions in the water. If
both waves would have had a troughs measuring $-3$ cm, then
they combine to make an extra-deep $-6$ cm trough. A $+3$ cm
crest and a $-3$ cm trough result in a height of zero, i.e.,
the waves momentarily cancel each other out at that point.
This additive rule is referred to as the principle of
superposition, ``superposition'' being merely a fancy word
for ``adding.''

Superposition can occur not just with sinusoidal waves like
the ones in the figure above but with waves of any shape.
The figures on the following page show superposition of wave
pulses. A pulse is simply a wave of very short duration.
These pulses consist only of a single hump or trough. If you
hit a clothesline sharply, you will observe pulses heading
off in both directions. This is analogous to the way ripples
spread out in all directions when you make a disturbance at
one point on water. The same occurs when the hammer on a
piano comes up and hits a string.

Experiments to date have not shown any deviation from the
principle of superposition in the case of light waves. For
other types of waves, it is typically a very good
approximation for low-energy waves.

The sequence of three photos in figure \figref{pete} shows a series of water
waves before it has reached a rubber duck (left), having
just passed the duck (middle) and having progressed about a
meter beyond the duck (right). The duck bobs around its
initial position, but is not carried along with the wave.
This shows that the water itself does not flow outward with
the wave. If it did, we could empty one end of a swimming
pool simply by kicking up waves! We must distinguish between
the motion of the medium (water in this case) and the motion
of the wave pattern through the medium. The medium vibrates;
the wave progresses through space.

\begin{eg}{Surfing}\label{eg:surfing}
The incorrect belief that the medium moves with the wave is
often reinforced by garbled secondhand knowledge of surfing.
Anyone who has actually surfed knows that the front of the
board pushes the water to the sides, creating a wake --- the
surfer can even drag his hand through the water, as in in figure
\figref{surfing-hand-drag}. If the
water was moving along with the wave and the surfer, this
wouldn't happen. The surfer is carried forward because
forward is downhill, not because of any forward flow of the
water. If the water was flowing forward, then a person
floating in the water up to her neck would be carried along
just as quickly as someone on a surfboard. In fact, it is
even possible to surf down the back side of a wave, although
the ride wouldn't last very long because the surfer and the
wave would quickly part company.

<% end_marg %>

A material object can move with any velocity, and can be
sped up or slowed down by a force that increases or
decreases its kinetic energy. Not so with waves. The
speed of a wave, depends on the properties of
the medium (and perhaps also on the shape of the wave, for
certain types of waves). Sound waves travel at about 340 m/s
in air, 1000 m/s in helium. If you kick up water waves in a
pool, you will find that kicking harder makes waves that are
taller (and therefore carry more energy), not faster. The
sound waves from an exploding stick of dynamite carry a lot
of energy, but are no faster than any other waves. In the
following section we will give an example of the physical
relationship between the wave speed and the properties of
the medium.

\begin{eg}{Breaking waves}\label{eg:breaking-wave}
The velocity of water waves
increases with depth. The crest of a wave
travels faster than the trough, and this can cause
the wave to break.
\end{eg}

Once a wave is created, the only reason its speed will
change is if it enters a different medium or if the
properties of the medium change. It is not so surprising
that a change in medium can slow down a wave, but the
reverse can also happen. A sound wave traveling through a
helium balloon will slow down when it emerges into the air,
but if it enters another balloon it will speed back up
again! Similarly, water waves travel more quickly over
deeper water, so a wave will slow down as it passes over an
underwater ridge, but speed up again as it emerges into
deeper water.

\begin{eg}{Hull speed}\label{eg:hull-speed}
 The speeds of most boats, and of some surface-swimming
animals, are limited by the fact that they make a wave due
to their motion through the water. The boat in figure \figref{hull-speed}
is going at the same speed as its own waves, and can't go any faster.
No matter how hard the boat pushes
against the water, it can't make the wave move ahead faster and get out of the
way. The wave's speed depends only on the medium. Adding energy to the wave
doesn't speed it up, it just increases its amplitude.

A water wave, unlike many other types of wave, has a speed
that depends on its shape: a broader wave moves faster. The
shape of the wave made by a boat tends to mold itself to
the shape of the boat's hull, so a boat with a longer hull
makes a broader wave that moves faster. The maximum speed of
a boat whose speed is limited by this effect is therefore
closely related to the length of its hull, and the maximum
speed is called the hull speed. Sailboats designed for racing are
not just long and skinny to make
them more streamlined --- they are also long so that their
hull speeds will be high.

\index{waves!patterns}
If the magnitude of a wave's velocity vector is preordained,
what about its direction? Waves spread out in all directions
from every point on the disturbance that created them. If
the disturbance is small, we may consider it as a single
point, and in the case of water waves the resulting wave
pattern is the familiar circular ripple, \figref{wave-patterns}/1. If, on the other
hand, we lay a pole on the surface of the water and wiggle
it up and down, we create a linear wave pattern, \figref{wave-patterns}/2. For a
three-dimensional wave such as a sound wave, the analogous
patterns would be spherical waves and plane waves,
\figref{wave-patterns-three-d}.

Infinitely many patterns are possible, but linear or plane
waves are often the simplest to analyze, because the
velocity vector is in the same direction no matter what part
of the wave we look at. Since all the velocity vectors are
parallel to one another, the problem is effectively
one-dimensional. Throughout this chapter and the next, we
will restrict ourselves mainly to wave motion in one
dimension, while not hesitating to broaden our horizons when
it can be done without too much complication.

So far you've learned some counterintuitive things about
the behavior of waves, but intuition can be trained. The
first half of this subsection aims to build your intuition by
investigating a simple, one-dimensional type of wave: a wave
on a string. If you have ever stretched a string between the
bottoms of two open-mouthed cans to talk to a friend, you
were putting this type of wave to work. Stringed instruments
are another good example. Although we usually think of a
piano wire simply as vibrating, the hammer actually strikes
it quickly and makes a dent in it, which then ripples out in
both directions. Since this chapter is about free waves, not
bounded ones, we pretend that our string is infinitely long.

<% end_marg %>

After the qualitative discussion, we will use simple
approximations to investigate the speed of a wave pulse on a
string. This quick and dirty treatment is then followed by a
rigorous attack using the methods of calculus, which
turns out to be both simpler and more general.

<% begin_sec("Intuitive ideas") %>

Consider a string that has been struck, \figref{pulse-on-string}/1, resulting in
the creation of two wave pulses, \figref{pulse-on-string}/2, one traveling to the
left and one to the right. This is analogous to the way
ripples spread out in all directions from a splash in water,
but on a one-dimensional string, ``all directions'' becomes
``both directions.''

We can gain insight by modeling the string as a series of
masses connected by springs, \figref{ball-and-spring-model}.
(In the actual string the mass
and the springiness are both contributed by the molecules
themselves.) If we look at various microscopic portions of
the string, there will be some areas that are flat, 1,
some that are sloping but not curved, 2, and some that are
curved, 3 and 4. In example 1 it is clear that both
the forces on the central mass cancel out, so it will not
accelerate. The same is true of 2, however. Only in curved
regions such as 3 and 4 is an acceleration produced. In
these examples, the vector sum of the two forces acting on
the central mass is not zero. The important concept is that
curvature makes force: the curved areas of a wave tend to
experience forces resulting in an acceleration toward the
mouth of the curve. Note, however, that an uncurved portion
of the string need not remain motionless. It may move at
constant velocity to either side.

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("Approximate treatment") %>

We now carry out an approximate treatment of the speed at
which two pulses will spread out from an initial indentation
on a string. For simplicity, we imagine a hammer blow that
creates a triangular dent, \figref{triangular-pulse}/1. We will estimate the amount
of time, $t$, required until each of the pulses has traveled a
distance equal to the width of the pulse itself. The
velocity of the pulses is then $\pm w/t$.

As always, the velocity of a wave depends on the properties
of the medium, in this case the string. The properties of
the string can be summarized by two variables: the tension,
$T$, and the mass per unit length, $\mu$ (Greek letter mu).

<% marg(1) %>
<%
  fig(
    'triangular-pulse',
    %q{A triangular pulse spreads out.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

If we consider the part of the string encompassed by the
initial dent as a single object, then this object has a mass
of approximately $\mu w$ (mass/length $\times\ \text{length}$=mass). (Here, and
throughout the derivation, we assume that $h$ is much less
than $w$, so that we can ignore the fact that this segment of
the string has a length slightly greater than $w$.) Although
the downward acceleration of this segment of the string will
be neither constant over time nor uniform across the pulse,
we will pretend that it is constant for the sake of our
simple estimate. Roughly speaking, the time interval between
\figref{triangular-pulse}/1 and \figref{triangular-pulse}/2
 is the amount of time required for the initial
dent to accelerate from rest and reach its normal, flattened
position. Of course the tip of the triangle has a longer
distance to travel than the edges, but again we ignore the
complications and simply assume that the segment as a whole
must travel a distance $h$.  Indeed, it might seem surprising
that the triangle would so neatly spring back to a perfectly
flat shape. It is an experimental fact that it does, but our
analysis is too crude to address such details.

The string is kinked, i.e., tightly curved, at the edges of
the triangle, so it is here that there will be large forces
that do not cancel out to zero. There are two forces acting
on the triangular hump, one of magnitude $T$ acting down and
to the right, and one of the same magnitude acting down and
to the left. If the angle of the sloping sides is $\theta$, then
the total force on the segment equals $2T \sin\theta$.
Dividing the triangle into two right triangles, we see that
$\sin\theta$ equals $h$ divided by the length of one of the
sloping sides. Since $h$ is much less than $w$, the length of
the sloping side is essentially the same as $w/2$, so we have
$\sin\theta = 2h/w$, and $F=4Th/w$. The acceleration of the
segment (actually the acceleration of its center of mass) is
\begin{align*}
        a        &=  \frac{F}{m} \\
                &=  \frac{4Th}{\mu w^2}\eqquad.
\end{align*}
The time required to move a distance $h$ under constant
acceleration $a$ is found by solving $h=(1/2)at^2$ to yield
\begin{align*}
        t        &=  \sqrt{2h/a} \\
                &=   w \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{2T}}\eqquad.
\end{align*}
Our final result for the speed of the pulses
is
\begin{align*}
        v        &=  w/t\\
                &=  \sqrt{\frac{2T}{\mu}}\eqquad.
\end{align*}

The remarkable feature of this result is that the velocity
of the pulses does not depend at all on $w$ or $h$, i.e., any
triangular pulse has the same speed. It is an experimental
fact (and we will also prove rigorously below)
that any pulse of any kind, triangular or
otherwise, travels along the string at the same speed. Of
course, after so many approximations we cannot expect to
have gotten all the numerical factors right. The correct
result for the speed of the pulses is
\begin{equation*}
        v        =  \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

The importance of the above derivation lies in the insight
it brings ---that all pulses move with the same speed --- rather
than in the details of the numerical result. The reason for
our too-high value for the velocity is not hard to guess. It
comes from the assumption that the acceleration was
constant, when actually the total force on the segment would
diminish as it flattened out.

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("Treatment using calculus") %>

After expending considerable effort for an approximate
solution, we now display the power of calculus with a
rigorous and completely general treatment that is
nevertheless much shorter and easier. Let the flat position
of the string define the $x$ axis, so that $y$ measures how far
a point on the string is from equilibrium. The motion of the
string is characterized by $y(x,t)$, a function of two
variables. Knowing that the force on any small segment of
string depends on the curvature of the string in that area,
and that the second derivative is a measure of curvature, it
is not surprising to find that the infinitesimal force $\der F$
acting on an infinitesimal segment $\der x$ is given
by
\begin{equation*}
        \der F        = T\:\frac{\partial^2y}{\partial x^2} \der x\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
(This can be proved by vector addition of the two
infinitesimal forces acting on either side.) The symbol $\partial$ stands
for a partial derivative, e.g., $\partial/\partial x$ means 
a derivative with respect to $x$ that is evaluated while treating $t$ as a constant. The
acceleration is then $a =\der F/\der m$, or, substituting
$\der m=\mu \der x$,
\begin{equation*}
        \frac{\partial^2y}{\partial t^2}        = \frac{T}{\mu}\:\frac{\partial^2y}{\partial x^2}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
The second derivative with respect to time is related to the
second derivative with respect to position. This is no more
than a fancy mathematical statement of the intuitive fact
developed above, that the string accelerates so as to
flatten out its curves.

Before even bothering to look for solutions to this
equation, we note that it already proves the principle of
superposition, because the derivative of a sum is the sum of
the derivatives. Therefore the sum of any two solutions will
also be a solution.

Based on experiment, we expect that this equation will be
satisfied by any function $y(x,t)$ that describes a pulse or
wave pattern moving to the left or right at the correct
speed $v$. In general, such a function will be of the form
$y=f(x-vt)$ or $y=f(x+vt)$, where $f$ is any function of one
variable. Because of the chain rule, each derivative with
respect to time brings out a factor of $v$. Evaluating the
second derivatives on both sides of the equation
gives
\begin{equation*}
        (\pm v)^2\: f''  =  \frac{T}{\mu}\:f''\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Squaring gets rid of the sign, and we find that we have a
valid solution for any function $f$, provided that $v$ is given
by
\begin{equation*}
        v =  \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

\index{waves!sound}\index{sound!waves}
The phenomenon of sound is easily found to have all the
characteristics we expect from a wave phenomenon:

- Sound waves obey superposition. Sounds do not knock other
sounds out of the way when they collide, and we can hear
more than one sound at once if they both reach our ear
simultaneously.

- The medium does not move with the sound. Even standing in
front of a titanic speaker playing earsplitting music, we do
not feel the slightest breeze.

- The velocity of sound depends on the medium. Sound travels
faster in helium than in air, and faster in water than in
helium. Putting more energy into the wave makes it more
intense, not faster. For example, you can easily detect an
echo when you clap your hands a short distance from a large,
flat wall, and the delay of the echo is no shorter for a
louder clap.

Although not all waves have a speed that is independent of
the shape of the wave, and this property therefore is
irrelevant to our collection of evidence that sound is a
wave phenomenon, sound does nevertheless have this property.
For instance, the music in a large concert hall or stadium
may take on the order of a second to reach someone seated in
the nosebleed section, but we do not notice or care, because
the delay is the same for every sound. Bass, drums, and
vocals all head outward from the stage at 340 m/s,
regardless of their differing wave shapes. (The speed of sound
in a gas is related to the gas's physical properties in example \ref{eg:speed-of-sound} 
on p.~\pageref{eg:speed-of-sound}.)

If sound has all the properties we expect from a wave, then
what type of wave is it? It is a series of compressions and
expansions of the air. Even for a very loud sound, the
increase or decrease compared to normal atmospheric pressure
is no more than a part per million, so our ears are
apparently very sensitive instruments. In a vacuum, there is
no medium for the sound waves, and so they cannot exist. The
roars and whooshes of space ships in Hollywood movies are
fun, but scientifically wrong.

Entirely similar observations lead us to believe that light
is a wave, although the concept of light as a wave had a
long and tortuous history.  It is interesting to note that
Isaac Newton very influentially advocated a contrary idea
about light. The belief that matter was made of atoms was
stylish at the time among radical thinkers (although there
was no experimental evidence for their existence), and it
seemed logical to Newton that light as well should be made
of tiny particles, which he called corpuscles (Latin for
``small objects''). Newton's triumphs in the science of
mechanics, i.e., the study of matter, brought him such great
prestige that nobody bothered to question his incorrect
theory of light for 150 years. One persuasive proof that
light is a wave is that according to Newton's theory, two
intersecting beams of light should experience at least some
disruption because of collisions between their corpuscles.
Even if the corpuscles were extremely small, and collisions
therefore very infrequent, at least some dimming should have
been measurable. In fact, very delicate experiments have
shown that there is no dimming.

The wave theory of light was entirely successful up until
the 20th century, when it was discovered that not all the
phenomena of light could be explained with a pure wave
theory. It is now believed that both light and matter are
made out of tiny chunks which have both wave and particle
properties. For now, we will content ourselves with the wave
theory of light, which is capable of explaining a great many
things, from cameras to rainbows.

If light is a wave, what is waving? What is the medium that
wiggles when a light wave goes by? It isn't air. A vacuum is
impenetrable to sound, but light from the stars travels
happily through zillions of miles of empty space. Light
bulbs have no air inside them, but that doesn't prevent the
light waves from leaving the filament. For a long time,
physicists assumed that there must be a mysterious medium
for light waves, and they called it the ether (not to be
confused with the chemical). Supposedly the ether existed
everywhere in space, and was immune to vacuum pumps. The
details of the story are more fittingly reserved for later
in this course, but the end result was that a long series of
experiments failed to detect any evidence for the ether, and
it is no longer believed to exist. Instead, light can be
explained as a wave pattern made up of electrical and
magnetic fields.

<% begin_sec("Period and frequency of a periodic wave") %>

You choose a radio station by selecting a certain frequency.
We have already defined period and frequency for vibrations,
\begin{align*}
        T        &= \text{period} = \text{seconds per cycle} \\
        f        &= \text{frequency} = 1/T = \text{cycles per second} \\
        \omega        &= \text{angular frequency} = 2\pi f= \text{radians per second}
\end{align*}
but what do they signify in the case of a wave? We can
recycle our previous definition simply by stating it in
terms of the vibrations that the wave causes as it passes a
receiving instrument at a certain point in space. For a
sound wave, this receiver could be an eardrum or a
microphone. If the vibrations of the eardrum repeat
themselves over and over, i.e., are periodic, then we
describe the sound wave that caused them as periodic.
Likewise we can define the period and frequency of a wave in
terms of the period and frequency of the vibrations it
causes. As another example, a periodic water wave would be
one that caused a rubber duck to bob in a periodic manner as
they passed by it.

The period of a sound wave correlates with our sensory
impression of musical pitch. A high frequency (short period)
is a high note. The sounds that really define the musical
notes of a song are only the ones that are periodic. It is
not possible to sing a nonperiodic sound like ``sh'' with a
definite pitch.

The frequency of a light wave corresponds to color. Violet
is the high-frequency end of the rainbow, red the
low-frequency end. A color like brown that does not occur in
a rainbow is not a periodic light wave. Many phenomena that
we do not normally think of as light are actually just forms
of light that are invisible because they fall outside the
range of frequencies our eyes can detect. Beyond the red end
of the visible rainbow, there are infrared and radio waves.
Past the violet end, we have ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma
rays.

<% begin_sec("Graphs of waves as a function of position") %>

Some waves, like sound waves, are easy to study by placing
a detector at a certain location in space and studying the
motion as a function of time. The result is a graph whose
horizontal axis is time. With a water wave, on the other
hand, it is simpler just to look at the wave directly. This
visual snapshot amounts to a graph of the height of the
water wave as a function of position. Any wave can be
represented in either way.

An easy way to visualize this is in terms of a strip chart
recorder, an obsolescing device consisting of a pen that
wiggles back and forth as a roll of paper is fed under it.
It can be used to record a person's electrocardiogram, or
seismic waves too small to be felt as a noticeable
earthquake but detectable by a seismometer. Taking the
seismometer as an example, the chart is essentially a record
of the ground's wave motion as a function of time, but if
the paper was set to feed at the same velocity as the motion
of an earthquake wave, it would also be a full-scale
representation of the profile of the actual wave pattern
itself. Assuming, as is usually the case, that the wave
velocity is a constant number regardless of the wave's
shape, knowing the wave motion as a function of time is
equivalent to knowing it as a function of position.

<% begin_sec("Wavelength") %>

Any wave that is periodic will also display a repeating
pattern when graphed as a function of position. The distance
spanned by one repetition is referred to as one wavelength.
The usual notation for wavelength is $\lambda$, the Greek letter
lambda. Wavelength is to space as period is to time.

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("Wave velocity related to frequency and wavelength") %>

Suppose that we create a repetitive disturbance by kicking
the surface of a swimming pool. We are essentially making a
series of wave pulses. The wavelength is simply the distance
a pulse is able to travel before we make the next pulse. The
distance between pulses is $\lambda$, and the time between pulses is
the period, $T$, so the speed of the wave is the distance
divided by the time,
\begin{equation*}
        v  =  \lambda/T\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
This important and useful relationship is more commonly
written in terms of the frequency, 
\begin{equation*}
        v  =  f\lambda\eqquad.

The speed of light is $ 3.0\times10^8\ \zu{m/s}$. What is
the wavelength of the radio waves emitted by KMHD, a station
whose frequency is 89.1 MHz?

\eganswer
Solving for wavelength, we have
\begin{align*}
        \lambda        &=   v/ f \\
                        &=  \zu{(3.0}\times10^8\ \zu{m/s)
                                /(89.1}\times10^6\ \sunit^{-1}) \\                        &=  \zu{3.4\ m}
\end{align*}
\end{eg}

The size of a radio antenna is closely related to the
wavelength of the waves it is intended to receive. The match
need not be exact (since after all one antenna can receive
more than one wavelength!), but the ordinary ``whip''
antenna such as a car's is 1/4 of a wavelength. An antenna
optimized to receive KMHD's signal would have a length of (3.4 m)/4 =
0.85 m.

The equation $v=f \lambda$  defines a fixed relationship between any
two of the variables if the other is held fixed. The speed
of radio waves in air is almost exactly the same for all
wavelengths and frequencies (it is exactly the same if they
are in a vacuum), so there is a fixed relationship between
their frequency and wavelength. Thus we can say either ``Are
we on the same wavelength?'' or ``Are we on the same
frequency?''

A different example is the behavior of a wave that travels
from a region where the medium has one set of properties to
an area where the medium behaves differently. The frequency
is now fixed, because otherwise the two portions of the wave
would otherwise get out of step, causing a kink or
discontinuity at the boundary, which would be unphysical. (A
more careful argument is that a kink or discontinuity would
have infinite curvature, and waves tend to flatten out their
curvature. An infinite curvature would flatten out
infinitely fast, i.e., it could never occur in the first
place.) Since the frequency must stay the same, any change
in the velocity that results from the new medium must cause
a change in wavelength.

The velocity of water waves depends on the depth of the
water, so based on $\lambda=v/f$, we see that water waves that move
into a region of different depth must change their
wavelength, as shown in figure  \figref{wavelengthshortening}. This effect
can be observed when ocean waves come up to the shore. If
the deceleration of the wave pattern is sudden enough, the
tip of the wave can curl over, resulting in a breaking wave.

The discussion of wave velocity
given here is actually a little bit of an oversimplification
for a wave whose velocity depends on its frequency and
wavelength. Such a wave is called a dispersive wave. Nearly
all the waves we deal with in this course are nondispersive,
but the issue becomes important in chapter \ref{ch:quantum},
where it is discussed in detail.

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("Sinusoidal waves") %>

Sinusoidal waves are the most important special case of
periodic waves. In fact, many scientists and engineers would
be uncomfortable with defining a waveform like the ``ah''
vowel sound as having a definite frequency and wavelength,
because they consider only sine waves to be pure examples of
a certain frequency and wavelengths. Their bias is not
unreasonable, since the French mathematician Fourier showed
that any periodic wave with frequency $f$ can be constructed
as a superposition of sine waves with frequencies
$f,\ 2f,\ 3f,\ \ldots$ In this sense, sine waves are the basic, pure building
blocks of all waves. (Fourier's result so surprised the
mathematical community of France that he was ridiculed the
first time he publicly presented his theorem.)\index{Fourier's theorem}

However, what definition to use is really a matter of
convenience. Our sense of hearing perceives any two sounds
having the same period as possessing the same pitch,
regardless of whether they are sine waves or not. This is
undoubtedly because our ear-brain system evolved to be able
to interpret human speech and animal noises, which are
periodic but not sinusoidal. Our eyes, on the other hand,
judge a color as pure (belonging to the rainbow set of
colors) only if it is a sine wave.

<% begin_sec("The Doppler effect",nil,'doppler') %>
\index{Doppler shift}
Figure \figref{doppler} shows the wave pattern made by the tip of a
vibrating rod which is moving across the water. If the rod
had been vibrating in one place, we would have seen the
familiar pattern of concentric circles, all centered on the
same point. But since the source of the waves is moving, the
wavelength is shortened on one side and lengthened on the
other. This is known as the Doppler effect.

<% marg(20) %>
<%
  fig(
    'doppler',
    %q{%
      The pattern of waves made by a point source moving to the

      forward-emitted waves and the longer wavelength of the
      backward-going ones.
    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

Note that the velocity of the waves is a fixed property of
the medium, so for example the forward-going waves do not
get an extra boost in speed as would a material object like
a bullet being shot forward from an airplane.

We can also infer a change in frequency. Since the velocity
is constant, the equation $v=f\lambda$ tells us that the change in
wavelength must be matched by an opposite change in
frequency: higher frequency for the waves emitted forward,
and lower for the ones emitted backward. The frequency
Doppler effect is the reason for the familiar dropping-pitch
sound of a race car going by. As the car approaches us, we
hear a higher pitch, but after it passes us we hear a
frequency that is lower than normal.

The Doppler effect will also occur if the observer is moving
but the source is stationary. For instance, an observer
moving toward a stationary source will perceive one crest of
the wave, and will then be surrounded by the next crest
sooner than she otherwise would have, because she has moved
toward it and hastened her encounter with it. Roughly
speaking, the Doppler effect depends only the relative
motion of the source and the observer, not on their absolute
state of motion (which is not a well-defined notion in
physics) or on their velocity relative to the medium.

Restricting ourselves to the case of a moving source, and to
waves emitted either directly along or directly against the
direction of motion, we can easily calculate the wavelength,
or equivalently the frequency, of the Doppler-shifted waves.
Let $u$ be the velocity of
the source. The wavelength of the forward-emitted waves is
shortened by an amount $uT$ equal to the distance traveled by
the source over the course of one period. Using the
definition $f=1/T$ and the equation $v=f\lambda$, we find for the
wavelength $\lambda'$ of the Doppler-shifted wave the equation
\begin{equation*}
        \lambda' = \left(1-\frac{u}{v}\right)\:\lambda\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
A similar equation can be used for the backward-emitted
waves, but with a plus sign rather than a minus sign.

\begin{eg}{Doppler-shifted sound from a race car}
\egquestion
If a race car moves at a velocity of 50 m/s, and
the velocity of sound is 340 m/s, by what percentage are the
wavelength and frequency of its sound waves shifted for an
observer lying along its line of motion?

\eganswer
For an observer whom the car is approaching, we
find
\begin{equation*}
        1-\frac{ u}{ v}=   0.85\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
so the shift in wavelength is 15\%. Since the frequency is
inversely proportional to the wavelength for a fixed value
of the speed of sound, the frequency is shifted upward
by
\begin{equation*}
        \zu{1/0.85        =  1.18}  ,
\end{equation*}
i.e., a change of 18\%. (For velocities that are small
compared to the wave velocities, the Doppler shifts of the
wavelength and frequency are about the same.)
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Doppler shift of the light emitted by a race car}
\egquestion
What is the percent shift in the wavelength of the
light waves emitted by a race car's headlights?

\eganswer
Looking up the speed of light in the back of the
book, $v= 3.0\times10^8\ \zu{m/s}$, we find
\begin{equation*}
        1-\frac{ u}{ v} \zu{=  0.99999983}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
i.e., the percentage shift is only 0.000017\%.
\end{eg}

The second example shows that under ordinary earthbound
circumstances, Doppler shifts of light are negligible
because ordinary things go so much slower than the speed of
light. It's a different story, however, when it comes to
stars and galaxies, and this leads us to a story that has
profound implications for our understanding of the origin of
the universe.

As soon as astronomers began looking at the sky through
telescopes, they began noticing certain objects that looked
like clouds in deep space. The fact that they looked the
same night after night meant that they were beyond the
earth's atmosphere. Not knowing what they really were, but
wanting to sound official, they called them ``nebulae,'' a
Latin word meaning ``clouds'' but sounding more impressive.
In the early 20th century, astronomers realized that
although some really were clouds of gas (e.g., the middle
``star'' of Orion's sword, which is visibly fuzzy even to
the naked eye when conditions are good), others were what we
now call galaxies: virtual island universes consisting of
trillions of stars (for example the Andromeda Galaxy, which
is visible as a fuzzy patch through binoculars). Three
hundred years after Galileo had resolved the Milky Way into
individual stars through his telescope, astronomers realized
that the universe is made of galaxies of stars, and the
Milky Way is simply the visible part of the flat disk of our
own galaxy, seen from inside.

This opened up the scientific study of cosmology, the
structure and history of the universe as a whole, a field
that had not been seriously attacked since the days of
Newton. Newton had realized that if gravity was always
attractive, never repulsive, the universe would have a
tendency to collapse. His solution to the problem was to
posit a universe that was infinite and uniformly populated
with matter, so that it would have no geometrical center.
The gravitational forces in such a universe would always
tend to cancel out by symmetry, so there would be no
collapse. By the 20th century, the belief in an unchanging
and infinite universe had become conventional wisdom in
science, partly as a reaction against the time that had been
wasted trying to find explanations of ancient geological
phenomena based on catastrophes suggested by biblical events
like Noah's flood.

In the 1920's astronomer Edwin Hubble began studying the\index{Hubble, Edwin}
Doppler shifts of the light emitted by galaxies. A former
college football player with a serious nicotine addiction,
Hubble did not set out to change our image of the beginning
of the universe. His autobiography seldom even mentions the
cosmological discovery for which he is now remembered. When
astronomers began to study the Doppler shifts of galaxies,
they expected that each galaxy's direction and velocity of
motion would be essentially random. Some would be
approaching us, and their light would therefore be
Doppler-shifted to the blue end of the spectrum, while an
equal number would be expected to have red shifts. What
Hubble discovered instead was that except for a few very
nearby ones, all the galaxies had red shifts, indicating
that they were receding from us at a hefty fraction of the
speed of light. Not only that, but the ones farther away
were receding more quickly. The speeds were directly
proportional to their distance from us.

Did this mean that the earth (or at least our galaxy) was
the center of the universe? No, because Doppler shifts of
light only depend on the relative motion of the source and
the observer. If we see a distant galaxy moving away from us
at 10\% of the speed of light, we can be assured that the
astronomers who live in that galaxy will see ours receding
from them at the same speed in the opposite direction. The
whole universe can be envisioned as a rising loaf of raisin
bread. As the bread expands, there is more and more space
between the raisins. The farther apart two raisins are, the
greater the speed with which they move apart.

The universe's expansion is presumably decelerating because
of gravitational attraction among the galaxies. We do not
presently know whether there is enough mass in the universe
to cause enough attraction to halt the expansion eventually.
But perhaps more interesting than the distant future of the
universe is what its present expansion implies about its
past. Extrapolating backward in time using the known laws of
physics, the universe must have been denser and denser at
earlier and earlier times. At some point, it must have been
extremely dense and hot, and we can even detect the
radiation from this early fireball, in the form of microwave
radiation that permeates space. The phrase Big Bang was
originally coined by the doubters of the theory to make it
sound ridiculous, but it stuck, and today essentially all
astronomers accept the Big Bang theory based on the very
direct evidence of the red shifts and the cosmic microwave
background radiation.

Finally it should be noted what the Big Bang theory is not.
It is not an explanation of \emph{why} the universe exists. Such
questions belong to the realm of religion, not science.
Science can find ever simpler and ever more fundamental
explanations for a variety of phenomena, but ultimately
science takes the universe as it is according to
observations.

Furthermore, there is an unfortunate tendency, even among
many scientists, to speak of the Big Bang theory as a
description of the very first event in the universe, which
caused everything after it. Although it is true that time
may have had a beginning (Einstein's theory of general
relativity admits such a possibility), the methods of
science can only work within a certain range of conditions
such as temperature and density. Beyond a temperature of
about $10^9$ K, the random thermal motion of subatomic
particles becomes so rapid that its velocity is comparable
to the speed of light. Early enough in the history of the
universe, when these temperatures existed, Newtonian physics
becomes less accurate, and we must describe nature using the
more general description given by Einstein's theory of
relativity, which encompasses Newtonian physics as a special
case. At even higher temperatures, beyond about $10^{33}$
degrees, physicists know that Einstein's theory as well
begins to fall apart, but we don't know how to construct the
even more general theory of nature that would work at those
temperatures. No matter how far physics progresses, we will
never be able to describe nature at infinitely high
temperatures, since there is a limit to the temperatures we
can explore by experiment and observation in order to guide
us to the right theory. We are confident that we understand
the basic physics involved in the evolution of the universe
starting a few minutes after the Big Bang, and we may be
able to push back to milliseconds or microseconds after it,
but we cannot use the methods of science to deal with the
beginning of time itself.

If Doppler shifts depend only on the relative motion of
the source and receiver, then there is no way for a person
moving with the source and another person moving with the
receiver to determine who is moving and who isn't. Either
can blame the Doppler shift entirely on the other's motion
and claim to be at rest herself. This is entirely in
agreement with the principle stated originally by Galileo
that all motion is relative.

On the other hand, a careful analysis of the Doppler shifts
of water or sound waves shows that it is only approximately
true, at low speeds, that the shifts  just depend on the
relative motion of the source and observer. For instance, it
is possible for a jet plane to keep up with its own sound
waves, so that the sound waves appear to stand still to the
pilot of the plane. The pilot then knows she is moving at
exactly the speed of sound. The reason this doesn't disprove
the relativity of motion is that the pilot is not really
determining her absolute motion but rather her motion
relative to the air, which is the medium of the sound waves.

Einstein realized that this solved the problem for sound or
water waves, but would not salvage the principle of relative
motion in the case of light waves, since light is not a
vibration of any physical medium such as water or air.
Beginning by imagining what a beam of light would look like
to a person riding a motorcycle alongside it, Einstein
eventually came up with a radical new way of describing the
universe, in which space and time are distorted as measured
by observers in different states of motion. As a consequence
of this Theory of Relativity, he showed that light waves
would have Doppler shifts that would exactly, not just
approximately, depend only on the relative motion of the
source and receiver.\index{Doppler effect!in relativity}

Speech is what separates humans most decisively from
animals. No other species can master syntax, and even though
chimpanzees can learn a vocabulary of hand signs, there is
an unmistakable difference between a human infant and a baby
chimp: starting from birth, the human experiments with the
production of complex speech sounds.

Since speech sounds are instinctive for us, we seldom think
about them consciously. How do we control sound waves so
skillfully? Mostly we do it by changing the shape of a
connected set of hollow cavities in our chest, throat, and
head. Somehow by moving the boundaries of this space in and
out, we can produce all the vowel sounds. Up until now, we
have been studying only those properties of waves that can
be understood as if they existed in an infinite, open space
with no boundaries. In this chapter we address what happens
when a wave is confined within a certain space, or when a
wave pattern encounters the boundary between two different
media, such as when a light wave moving through air
encounters a glass windowpane.

Sound waves can echo back from a cliff, and light waves are
reflected from the surface of a pond. We use the word
reflection, normally applied only to light waves in ordinary
speech, to describe any such case of a wave rebounding from
a barrier. Figure (a) shows a circular water wave being
reflected from a straight wall. In this chapter, we will
concentrate mainly on reflection of waves that move in one
dimension, as in figure \figref{reflspring}/1.

Wave reflection does not surprise us. After all, a material
object such as a rubber ball would bounce back in the same way.
But waves are not objects, and there are some surprises in
store.

First, only part of the wave is usually reflected. Looking
out through a window, we see light waves that passed through
it, but a person standing outside would also be able to see
her reflection in the glass. A light wave that strikes the
glass is partly reflected and partly transmitted (passed) by
the glass. The energy of the original wave is split between
the two. This is different from the behavior of the rubber
ball, which must go one way or the other, not both.

Second, consider what you see if you are swimming underwater
and you look up at the surface. You see your own reflection.
This is utterly counterintuitive, since we would expect the
light waves to burst forth to freedom in the wide-open air.
A material projectile shot up toward the surface would never
rebound from the water-air boundary!

What is it about the difference between two media that
causes waves to be partly reflected at the boundary between
them? Is it their density? Their chemical composition?
Typically all that matters is the speed of the wave in the
two media.\footnote{Some exceptions are described in sec.~\ref{subsec:technical-reflection},
p.~\pageref{subsec:technical-reflection}.}
\emph{A wave is partially reflected and partially
transmitted at the boundary between media in which it has
different speeds.} For example, the speed of light waves in
window glass is about 30\% less than in air, which explains
why windows always make reflections. Figure \figref{reflspring}
shows examples of wave pulses being reflected at the boundary
between two coil springs of different weights, in which the
wave speed is different.

Reflections such as \figref{circular-reflection-upright} and \figref{reflspring}/1,
where a wave encounters a
massive fixed object, can usually be understood on the same
basis as cases like \figref{reflspring}/2 and \figref{reflspring}/3 where two media meet.
Example \figref{reflspring}/1, for instance, is like a more extreme version of
example \figref{reflspring}/2. If the heavy coil spring in \figref{reflspring}/2 was made
heavier and heavier, it would end up acting like the fixed
wall to which the light spring in \figref{reflspring}/1 has been attached.

Why don't fish have ear-holes? The speed of sound waves in a

The use of the word ``reflection'' naturally brings to mind
the creation of an image by a mirror, but this might be
confusing, because we do not normally refer to
``reflection'' when we look at surfaces that are not shiny.
Nevertheless, reflection is how we see the surfaces of all
objects, not just polished ones. When we look at a sidewalk,
for example, we are actually seeing the reflecting of the
sun from the concrete. The reason we don't see an image of
the sun at our feet is simply that the rough surface blurs
the image so drastically.

Notice how the pulse reflected back to the right in example
 \figref{reflspring}/2 comes back upside-down, whereas the one reflected back

This is true for other waves as well. In general, there are
two possible types of reflections, a reflection back into a
faster medium and a reflection back into a slower medium.
One type will always be an inverting reflection and one
noninverting.

It's important to realize that when we discuss inverted and
uninverted reflections on a string, we are talking about
whether the wave is flipped across the direction of motion
(i.e., upside-down in these drawings). The reflected pulse
will always be reversed front to back, as shown in figures
\figref{uninverted} and \figref{inverted}. This is because it is traveling in the other
direction. The leading edge of the pulse is what gets
reflected first, so it is still ahead when it starts back to
the left --- it's just that ``ahead'' is now in the opposite
direction.

<% begin_sec("Absorption") %>

So far we have tacitly assumed that wave energy remains as
wave energy, and is not converted to any other form. If this
was true, then the world would become more and more full of
sound waves, which  could never escape into the vacuum of
outer space. In reality, any mechanical wave consists of a
traveling pattern of vibrations of some physical medium, and
vibrations of matter always produce heat, as when you bend a
coathangar back and forth and it becomes hot. We can thus
expect that in mechanical waves such as water waves, sound
waves, or waves on a string, the wave energy will gradually
be converted into heat. This is referred to as absorption.
The reduction in the wave's energy can also be described as
a reduction in amplitude, the relationship between them being,
as with a vibrating object, $E\propto A^2$.\index{wave!energy related to amplitude}

<% marg(0) %>
<%
  fig(
    'attenuation',
    %q{A pulse traveling through a highly absorptive medium.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

The wave suffers a decrease in amplitude, as shown in figure
\figref{attenuation}. The decrease in amplitude amounts to the same
fractional change for each unit of distance covered. For
example, if a wave decreases from amplitude 2 to amplitude 1
over a distance of 1 meter, then after traveling another
meter it will have an amplitude of 1/2. That is, the
reduction in amplitude is exponential. This can be proved as
follows. By the principle of superposition, we know that a
wave of amplitude 2 must behave like the superposition of
two identical waves of amplitude 1. If a single amplitude-1
wave would die down to amplitude 1/2 over a certain
distance, then two amplitude-1 waves superposed on top of
one another to make amplitude 1+1=2 must die down to
amplitude 1/2+1/2=1 over the same distance.

As a wave undergoes
absorption, it loses energy. Does this
mean that it slows down?
  SELF_CHECK
  ) %>

In many cases, this frictional heating effect is quite weak.
Sound waves in air, for instance, dissipate into heat
extremely slowly, and the sound of church music in a
cathedral may reverberate for as much as 3 or 4 seconds
before it becomes inaudible. During this time it has
traveled over a kilometer! Even this very gradual
dissipation of energy occurs mostly as heating of the
church's walls and by the leaking of sound to the outside
(where it will eventually end up as heat). Under the right
conditions (humid air and low frequency), a sound wave in a
straight pipe could theoretically travel hundreds of
kilometers before being noticeable attenuated.

In general, the absorption of mechanical waves depends a
great deal on the chemical composition and microscopic
structure of the medium. Ripples on the surface of
antifreeze, for instance, die out extremely rapidly compared
to ripples on water. For sound waves and surface waves in
liquids and gases, what matters is the viscosity of the
substance, i.e., whether it flows easily like water or
mercury or more sluggishly like molasses or antifreeze. This
explains why our intuitive expectation of strong absorption
of sound in water is incorrect. Water is a very weak
absorber of sound (viz. whale songs and sonar), and our
incorrect intuition arises from focusing on the wrong
property of the substance: water's high density, which is
irrelevant, rather than its low viscosity, which is what
matters.

Light is an interesting case, since although it can travel
through matter, it is not itself a vibration of any material
substance. Thus we can look at the star Sirius, $10^{14}$ km away
from us, and be assured that none of its light was absorbed
in the vacuum of outer space during its 9-year journey to
us. The Hubble Space Telescope routinely observes light that
has been on its way to us since the early history of the
universe, billions of years ago. Of course the energy of
light can be dissipated if it does pass through matter (and
the light from distant galaxies is often absorbed if there
happen to be clouds of gas or dust in between).

\begin{eg}{Soundproofing}
Typical amateur musicians setting out to soundproof their
garages tend to think that they should simply cover the
walls with the densest possible substance. In fact, sound is
not absorbed very strongly even by passing through several
inches of wood. A better strategy for soundproofing is to
create a sandwich of alternating layers of materials in
which the speed of sound is very different, to encourage
reflection.

The classic design is alternating layers of fiberglass and
plywood. The speed of sound in plywood is very high, due to
its stiffness, while its speed in fiberglass is essentially
the same as its speed in air. Both materials are fairly good
sound absorbers, but sound waves passing through a few
inches of them are still not going to be absorbed
sufficiently. The point of combining them is that a sound
wave that tries to get out will be strongly reflected at
each of the fiberglass-plywood boundaries, and will bounce
back and forth many times like a ping pong ball. Due to all
the back-and-forth motion, the sound may end up traveling a
total distance equal to ten times the actual thickness of
the soundproofing before it escapes. This is the equivalent
of having ten times the thickness of sound-absorbing
material.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Radio transmission}
A radio transmitting station must have a length of
wire or cable connecting the amplifier to the antenna. The
cable and the antenna act as two different media for radio
waves, and there will therefore be partial reflection of the
waves as they come from the cable to the antenna. If the
waves bounce back and forth many times between the amplifier
and the antenna, a great deal of their energy will be
absorbed. There are two ways to attack the problem. One
possibility is to design the antenna so that the speed of
the waves in it is as close as possible to the speed of the waves in the
cable; this minimizes the amount of reflection. The other method is to
connect the amplifier to the antenna using a type of wire or
cable that does not strongly absorb the waves. Partial
reflection then becomes irrelevant, since all the wave
energy will eventually exit through the antenna.

<% begin_sec("Quantitative treatment of reflection",nil,'quantitative-reflection') %>

In this section we use the example of waves on a string to analyze the reasons why a
reflection occurs at the boundary between media, predict
quantitatively the intensities of reflection and transmission,
and discuss how to tell which
reflections are inverting and which are noninverting. Some technical details
are relegated to sec.~\ref{subsec:technical-reflection}, p.~\pageref{subsec:technical-reflection}.

<% begin_sec("Why reflection occurs") %>

To understand the fundamental reasons for what does occur at
the boundary between media, let's first discuss what doesn't
happen. For the sake of concreteness, consider a sinusoidal
wave on a string. If the wave progresses from a heavier
portion of the string, in which its velocity is low, to a
lighter-weight part, in which it is high, then the equation
$v=f\lambda$ tells us that it must change its frequency, or its
wavelength, or both. If only the frequency changed, then the
parts of the wave in the two different portions of the
string would quickly get out of step with each other,
producing a discontinuity in the wave, \figref{kink-and-discontinuity}/1. This is
unphysical, so we know that the wavelength must change while
the frequency remains constant, \figref{kink-and-discontinuity}/2.

<% marg(40) %>
<%
  fig(
    'kink-and-discontinuity',
    %q{%
      1. A change in frequency without a change in wavelength
      would produce a discontinuity in the wave.\\
      2. A simple change in wavelength without a reflection would result in a sharp kink in the wave.
    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

But there is still something unphysical about figure \figref{kink-and-discontinuity}/2.
The sudden change in the shape of the wave has resulted in a
sharp kink at the boundary. This can't really happen,
because the medium tends to accelerate in such a way as to
eliminate curvature. A sharp kink corresponds to an infinite
curvature at one point, which would produce an infinite
acceleration, which would not be consistent with the smooth
pattern of wave motion envisioned in fig. \figref{kink-and-discontinuity}/2. Waves can
have kinks, but not stationary kinks.

We conclude that without positing partial reflection of the
wave, we cannot simultaneously satisfy the requirements of
(1) continuity of the wave, and (2) no sudden changes in the
slope of the wave. In other words, we assume that both
the wave and its derivative are continuous functions.)

Does this amount to a proof that reflection occurs? Not
quite. We have only proved that certain types of wave motion
are not valid solutions. In the following subsection, we
prove that a valid solution can always be found in which a
reflection occurs. Now in physics, we normally assume (but
seldom prove formally) that the equations of motion have a
unique solution, since otherwise a given set of initial
conditions could lead to different behavior later on, but
the Newtonian universe is supposed to be deterministic.
Since the solution must be unique, and we derive below a
valid solution involving a reflected pulse, we will have
ended up with what amounts to a proof of reflection.

<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("Intensity of reflection",nil,'intensity-of-reflection') %>

I will now show, in the case of waves on a string, that it
is possible to satisfy the physical requirements given above
by constructing a reflected wave, and as a bonus this will
produce an equation for the proportions of reflection and
transmission and a prediction as to which conditions will
lead to inverted and which to uninverted reflection. We
assume only that the principle of superposition holds, which
is a good approximation for waves on a string of
sufficiently small amplitude.

      pulse begins to emerge from the boundary, it adds together

%>
<% end_marg %>

Let the unknown amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted
waves be $R$ and $T$, respectively. An inverted reflection would
be represented by a negative value of $R$. We can without loss
of generality take the incident (original) wave to have unit
amplitude. Superposition tells us that if, for instance, the
incident wave had double this amplitude, we could
immediately find a corresponding solution simply by doubling
$R$ and $T$.

Just to the left of the boundary, the height of the wave is
given by the height 1 of the incident wave, plus the height
$R$ of the part of the reflected wave that has just been
created and begun heading back, for a total height of $1+R$.
On the right side immediately next to the boundary, the
transmitted wave has a height $T$. To avoid a discontinuity,
we must have
\begin{equation*}
        1+R = T\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

Next we turn to the requirement of equal slopes on both
sides of the boundary. Let the slope of the incoming wave be
s immediately to the left of the junction. If the wave was
100\% reflected, and without inversion, then the slope of the
reflected wave would be $-s$, since the wave has been reversed
in direction. In general, the slope of the reflected wave
equals $-sR$, and the slopes of the superposed waves on the
left side add up to $s-sR$. On the right, the slope depends on
the amplitude, $T$, but is also changed by the stretching or
compression of the wave due to the change in speed. If, for
example, the wave speed is twice as great on the right side,
then the slope is cut in half by this effect. The slope on
the right is therefore $s(v_1/v_2)T$, where $v_1$ is the velocity
in the original medium and $v_2$ the velocity in the new
medium. Equality of slopes gives $s-sR = s(v_1/v_2)T$, or
\begin{equation*}
        1-R = \frac{v_1}{v_2}T\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Solving the two equations for the unknowns $R$ and $T$
gives\label{reflected-wave-amplitude}
\begin{align*}
        R &=  \frac{v_2-v_1}{v_2+v_1}  \\ 
\intertext{and}
          T &= \frac{2v_2}{v_2+v_1}\eqquad.
\end{align*}

The first equation shows that there is no reflection unless
the two wave speeds are different, and that the reflection
is inverted in reflection back into a fast medium.

The energies of the transmitted and reflected wavers always
add up to the same as the energy of the original wave. There
is never any abrupt loss (or gain) in energy when a wave
crosses a boundary; conversion of wave energy to heat occurs
for many types of waves, but it occurs throughout the
medium. The equation for $T$, surprisingly, allows the
amplitude of the transmitted wave to be greater than 1, i.e.,
greater than that of the incident wave. This does not
violate conservation of energy, because this occurs when the
second string is less massive, reducing its kinetic energy,
and the transmitted pulse is broader and less strongly
curved, which lessens its potential energy. In other words,
the constant of proportionality in $E\propto A^2$ is different
in the two different media.

We have attempted to develop some general facts about wave reflection by using
the specific example of a wave on a string, which raises the question of whether
these facts really are general. These issues are discussed in more detail in
optional section \ref{subsec:technical-reflection}, p.~\pageref{subsec:technical-reflection},
but here is a brief summary.

The following facts are more generally true for wave reflection in one dimension.

\begin{itemize}
\item The wave is partially reflected and partially transmitted, with the reflected and transmitted
        parts sharing the energy.
\item For an interface between media 1 and 2, there are two possible reflections: back into 1,
        and back into 2. One of these is inverting ($R<0$) and the other is noninverting ($R>0$).
\end{itemize}

The following aspects of our analysis may need to be modified for different types of waves.

\begin{itemize} 
\item In some cases, the expressions for the reflected and transmitted amplitudes depend
        not on the ratio $v_1/v_2$ but on some more complicated ratio $v_1\ldots/v_2\ldots$,
        where $\ldots$ stands for some additional property of the medium.
\item The sign of $R$, depends not just on this ratio but also on the
        type of the wave and on what we choose as a measure of amplitude.

If you look at the front of a pair of high-quality
binoculars, you will notice a greenish-blue coating on the
lenses. This is advertised as a coating to prevent
reflection. Now reflection is clearly undesirable --- we want
the light to go in the binoculars --- but so far I've
described reflection as an unalterable fact of nature,
depending only on the properties of the two wave media. The
coating can't change the speed of light in air or in glass,
so how can it work? The key is that the coating itself is a
wave medium. In other words, we have a three-layer sandwich
of materials: air, coating, and glass. We will analyze the
way the coating works, not because optical coatings are an
important part of your education but because it provides a
good example of the general phenomenon of wave interference
effects.

<% end_marg %>

There are two different interfaces between media: an
air-coating boundary and a coating-glass boundary. Partial
reflection and partial transmission will occur at each
boundary. For ease of visualization let's start by
considering an equivalent system consisting of three
dissimilar pieces of string tied together, and a wave
pattern consisting initially of a single pulse. Figure \figref{rope-with-three-parts}/1
shows the incident pulse moving through the heavy rope, in
which its velocity is low. When it encounters the
lighter-weight rope in the middle, a faster medium, it is
partially reflected and partially transmitted. (The
transmitted pulse is bigger, but nevertheless has only part
of the original energy.) The pulse transmitted by the first
interface is then partially reflected and partially
transmitted by the second boundary, \figref{rope-with-three-parts}/3. 
In figure \figref{rope-with-three-parts}/4, two
pulses are on the way back out to the left, and a single
pulse is heading off to the right. (There is still a weak
pulse caught between the two boundaries, and this will
rattle back and forth, rapidly getting too weak to detect as
it leaks energy to the outside with each partial
reflection.)

Note how, of the two reflected pulses in \figref{rope-with-three-parts}/4, one is inverted
and one uninverted. One underwent  reflection at the first
boundary (a reflection back into a slower medium is
uninverted), but the other was reflected at the second
boundary (reflection back into a faster medium is inverted).

Now let's imagine what would have happened if the incoming
wave pattern had been a long sinusoidal wave train instead
of a single pulse. The first two waves to reemerge on the
left could be in phase, \figref{inverted-sine-wave-trailing}/1, or out of phase, \figref{inverted-sine-wave-trailing}/2, or
anywhere in between. The amount of lag between them depends
entirely on the width of the middle segment of string.
If we choose the width of the middle string segment
correctly, then we can arrange for destructive interference
to occur, \figref{inverted-sine-wave-trailing}/2, with cancellation resulting in a very weak
reflected wave.

This whole analysis applies directly to our original case of
optical coatings. Visible light from most sources does
consist of a stream of short sinusoidal wave-trains such as
the ones drawn above. The only real difference between the
waves-on-a-rope example and the case of an optical coating
is that the first and third media are air and glass, in
which light does not have the same speed. However, the
general result is the same as long as the air and the glass
have light-wave speeds that are either both greater than the
coating's or both less than the coating's.

The business of optical coatings turns out to be a very
arcane one, with a plethora of trade secrets and ``black
magic'' techniques handed down from master to apprentice.
Nevertheless, the ideas you have learned about waves in
general are sufficient to allow you to come to some definite
conclusions without any further technical knowledge. The
self-check and discussion questions will direct you along
these lines of thought.

In the example of the previous section, it was theoretically
true that a pulse would be trapped permanently in the middle
medium, but that pulse was not central to our discussion,
and in any case it was weakening severely with each partial
reflection. Now consider a guitar string. At its ends it is
tied to the body of the instrument itself, and since the
body is very massive, the behavior of the waves when they
reach the end of the string can be understood in the same
way as if the actual guitar string was attached on the ends
to strings that were extremely massive. Reflections are most
intense when the two media are very dissimilar. Because the
wave speed in the body is so radically different from the
speed in the string, we should expect nearly 100\%
reflection.

Although this may seem like a rather bizarre physical model
of the actual guitar string, it already tells us something
interesting about the behavior of a guitar that we would not
otherwise have understood. The body, far from being a
passive frame for attaching the strings to, is actually the
exit path for the wave energy in the strings. With every
reflection, the wave pattern on the string loses a tiny
fraction of its energy, which is then conducted through the
body and out into the air. (The string has too little
cross-section to make sound waves efficiently by itself.) By
changing the properties of the body, moreover, we should
expect to have an effect on the manner in which sound
escapes from the instrument. This is clearly demonstrated by
the electric guitar, which has an extremely massive, solid
wooden body. Here the dissimilarity between the two wave
media is even more pronounced, with the result that wave
energy leaks out of the string even more slowly. This is why
an electric guitar with no electric pickup can hardly be
heard at all, and it is also the reason why notes on an
electric guitar can be sustained for longer than notes on an
acoustic guitar.

If we initially create a disturbance on a guitar string, how
will the reflections behave? In reality, the finger or pick
will give the string a triangular shape before letting it
go, and we may think of this triangular shape as a very
broad ``dent'' in the string which will spread out in both
directions. For simplicity, however, let's just imagine a
wave pattern that initially consists of a single, narrow
pulse traveling up the neck, \figref{period-of-pulse-on-guitar}/1. After reflection from the
top end, it is inverted, \figref{period-of-pulse-on-guitar}/3. Now something interesting
happens: figure \figref{period-of-pulse-on-guitar}/5 is identical to figure \figref{period-of-pulse-on-guitar}/1. After two
reflections, the pulse has been inverted twice and has
changed direction twice. It is now back where it started.
The motion is periodic. This is why a guitar produces sounds
that have a definite sensation of pitch.

<% self_check('passtwice',<<-'SELF_CHECK'
Notice that from \figref{period-of-pulse-on-guitar}/1
 to \figref{period-of-pulse-on-guitar}/5, the pulse has passed by every
point on the string exactly twice. This means that the total
distance it has traveled equals 2 L, where  L is the length of
the string. Given this fact, what are the period and
frequency of the sound it produces, expressed in terms of  L
and  v, the velocity of the wave?

Note that if the waves on the string obey the principle of
superposition, then the velocity must be independent of
amplitude, and the guitar will produce the same pitch
regardless of whether it is played loudly or softly. In
reality, waves on a string obey the principle of
superposition approximately, but not exactly. The guitar,
like just about any acoustic instrument, is a little out of
tune when played loudly. (The effect is more pronounced for
wind instruments than for strings, but wind players are able
to compensate for it.)

Now there is only one hole in our reasoning. Suppose we
somehow arrange to have an initial setup consisting of two
identical pulses heading toward each other, as in figure
(g). They will pass through each other, undergo a single
inverting reflection, and come back to a configuration in
which their positions have been exactly interchanged. This
means that the period of vibration is half as long. The
frequency is twice as high.

This might seem like a purely academic possibility, since
nobody actually plays the guitar with two picks at once! But
in fact it is an example of a very general fact about waves
that are bounded on both sides. A mathematical theorem
called Fourier's theorem states that any wave can be created
by superposing sine waves. Figure \figref{fourier} shows how
even by using only four sine waves with appropriately chosen
amplitudes, we can arrive at a sum which is a decent
approximation to the realistic triangular shape of a guitar
string being plucked. The one-hump wave, in which half a
wavelength fits on the string, will behave like the single
pulse we originally discussed. We call its frequency $f_\zu{o}$. The
two-hump wave, with one whole wavelength, is very much like
the two-pulse example. For the reasons discussed above, its
frequency is $2f_\zu{o}$. Similarly, the three-hump and four-hump
waves have frequencies of $3f_\zu{o}$ and  $4f_\zu{o}$.

Theoretically we would need to add together infinitely many
such wave patterns to describe the initial triangular shape
of the string exactly, although the amplitudes required for
the very high frequency parts would be very small, and an
excellent approximation could be achieved with as few as ten
waves.

We thus arrive at the following very general conclusion.
Whenever a wave pattern exists in a medium bounded on both
sides by media in which the wave speed is very different,
the motion can be broken down into the motion of a
(theoretically infinite) series of sine waves, with
frequencies $f_\zu{o},\ 2f_\zu{o},\ 3f_\zu{o},\ \ldots$
Except for some technical
details, to be discussed below, this analysis applies to a
vast range of sound-producing systems, including the air
column within the human vocal tract. Because sounds composed
of this kind of pattern of frequencies are so common, our
ear-brain system has evolved so as to perceive them as a
single, fused sensation of tone.

Many musicians claim to be able to pick out by ear
several of the frequencies $2f_\zu{o}$, $3f_\zu{o}$, ..., called
\index{fourier-spectra}overtones or \index{harmonics}\emph{harmonics} of the fundamental $f_\zu{o}$,\index{fundamental}
but they are kidding themselves. In reality, the overtone
series has two important roles in music, neither of which
depends on this fictitious ability to ``hear out'' the
individual overtones.

First, the relative strengths of the overtones is an
important part of the personality of a sound, called its
timbre (rhymes with ``amber''). The characteristic tone of
the brass instruments, for example, is a sound that starts
out with a very strong harmonic series extending up to very
high frequencies, but whose higher harmonics die down
drastically as the attack changes to the sustained portion
of the note.

Second, although the ear cannot separate the individual
harmonics of a single musical tone, it is very sensitive to
clashes between the overtones of notes played
simultaneously, i.e., in harmony. We tend to perceive a
combination of notes as being dissonant if they have
overtones that are close but not the same. Roughly speaking,
strong overtones whose frequencies differ by more than 1\%
and less than 10\% cause the notes to sound dissonant. It is
important to realize that the term ``dissonance'' is not a
negative one in music. No matter how long you search the
radio dial, you will never hear more than three seconds of
music without at least one dissonant combination of notes.
Dissonance is a necessary ingredient in the creation of a
musical cycle of tension and release. Musically
knowledgeable people do not usually use the word
``dissonant'' as a criticism of music, and if they do, what
they are really saying is that the dissonance has been used in a
clumsy way, or without providing any contrast between
dissonance and consonance.

Figure \figref{standing-waves-on-floor} shows sinusoidal wave patterns made by
shaking a rope. I used to enjoy doing this at the bank with
the pens on chains, back in the days when people actually
went to the bank. You might think that I and the person in
the photos had to practice for a long time in order to get
such nice sine waves. In fact, a sine wave is the only shape
that can create this kind of wave pattern, called a \emph{standing
wave},\index{standing wave} which simply vibrates back and forth in one place
without moving. The sine wave just creates itself
automatically when you find the right frequency, because no
other shape is possible.

If you think about it, it's not even obvious that sine waves
should be able to do this trick. After all, waves are
supposed to travel at a set speed, aren't they? The speed
isn't supposed to be zero! Well, we can actually think of a
standing wave as a superposition of a moving sine wave with
its own reflection, which is moving the opposite way. Sine
waves have the unique mathematical property that the sum of
sine waves of equal wavelength is simply a new sine wave
with the same wavelength. As the two sine waves go  back and
forth, they always cancel perfectly at the ends, and their
sum appears to stand still.

<% begin_sec("Standing-wave patterns of air columns") %>

The air column inside a wind instrument 
behaves very much like the wave-on-a-string example
we've been concentrating on so far, the main difference
being that we may have either inverting or noninverting
reflections at the ends.

Some organ pipes are closed at both ends. The speed of sound is different
in metal than in air, so there is a strong reflection at the closed ends,
and we can have standing waves. These reflections are both density-noninverting,
so we get symmetric standing-wave patterns, such as the one shown in figure
\subfigref{lowest-modes-of-air-column}{1}.

Figure \figref{shakuhachi} shows the sound waves in and around a bamboo
Japanese flute called a shakuhachi, which is \emph{open} at both ends of the air
column. We can only have a standing wave pattern if there are reflections at the
ends, but that is very counterintuitive --- why is there any reflection at all,
if the sound wave is free to emerge into open space, and
there is no change in medium? Recall the reason why we got reflections at
a change in medium: because the wavelength changes, so the wave has to
readjust itself from one pattern to another, and the only way it can do
that without developing a kink is if there is a reflection.
Something similar is happening here. The only difference is that the wave
is adjusting from being a plane wave to being a spherical wave.
The reflections at
the open ends are density-inverting, \subfigref{lowest-modes-of-air-column}{2},
so the wave pattern is pinched off at the ends.
Comparing panels 1 and 2 of the figure, we see that although the wave patterns
are different, in both cases the wavelength is the same: in the lowest-frequency
standing wave, half a wavelength fits inside the tube. Thus, it isn't necessary
to memorize which type of reflection is inverting and which is uninverting. It's
only necessary to know that the tubes are symmetric.

<% end_marg %>

Finally, we can have an asymmetric tube: closed at one end and open at the
other. A common example is the pan pipes, \figref{pan-pipes}, which are closed
at the bottom and open at the top. The
standing wave with the lowest frequency
is therefore one in which 1/4 of a wavelength
fits along the length of the tube, as shown in figure \subfigref{lowest-modes-of-air-column}{3}.

Sometimes an instrument's physical appearance can be misleading. A concert flute,
\figref{flute}, is closed at the mouth end and open at the other, so we would expect it
to behave like an asymmetric air column; in reality, it behaves like a symmetric
air column open at both ends, because the embouchure hole (the hole the player blows
over) acts like an open end. The clarinet and the saxophone look similar,
having a mouthpiece and reed at one end and an open end at the other, but they act
different. In fact the clarinet's air column has patterns of vibration that are asymmetric, the
saxophone symmetric. The discrepancy comes from the difference between the conical
tube of the sax and the cylindrical tube of the clarinet. The adjustment of the wave
pattern from a plane wave to a spherical wave is more gradual at the flaring bell
of the saxophone.

overtone of the air column in a tube open at one end and

vibration at one end and a point of no vibration at the
other. How many times shorter will its wavelength be
compared to the frequency of the lowest-frequency standing
wave, shown in the figure? Based on this, how many times
greater will its frequency be?

\begin{eg}{The speed of sound}\label{eg:speed-of-sound}\index{sound!speed of}
We can get a rough and ready derivation of the equation for the speed of
sound by analyzing the standing waves in a cylindrical air column as a special type of
Helmholtz resonance (example \ref{eg:helmholtz-resonator} on page \pageref{eg:helmholtz-resonator}),
in which the cavity happens to have the same cross-sectional area as the neck. Roughly speaking,
the regions of maximum density variation act like the cavity. The regions of minimum density
variation, on the other hand, are the places where the velocity of the air is varying the most;
these regions throttle back the speed of the vibration, because of the inertia of the moving air.
If the cylinder has cross-sectional area $A$, then the ``cavity'' and ``neck'' parts of the wave
both have lengths of something like $\lambda/2$, and the volume of the ``cavity'' is about
$A\lambda/2$. We get $v=f\lambda=(\ldots)\sqrt{\gamma P_\zu{o}/\rho}$, where the factor
$(\ldots)$ represents numerical stuff that we can't possibly hope to have gotten right with
such a crude argument. The correct result is in fact $v=\sqrt{\gamma P_\zu{o}/\rho}$. Isaac
Newton attempted the same calculation, but didn't understand the thermodynamic effects involved,
and therefore got a result that didn't have the correct factor of $\sqrt{\gamma}$.

<% begin_sec("Some technical aspects of reflection",nil,'technical-reflection',{'optional'=>true}) %>

In this section we address some technical details of the treatment of reflection
and transmission of waves.

<% begin_sec("Dependence of reflection on other variables besides velocity",nil,'wave-reflection-impedance') %>

In section \ref{subsec:quantitative-reflection} we derived the expressions for the transmitted
and reflected amplitudes by demanding that two things match up on both sides of the boundary:
the height of the wave and the slope of the wave. These requirements were stated purely
in terms of kinematics (the description of how the wave moves) rather than dynamics (the
explanation for the wave motion in terms of Newton's laws). For this reason, the results
depended only on the purely kinematic quantity $\alpha=v_2/v_1$, as can be seen more clearly
if we rewrite the expressions in the following form:
\begin{equation*}
  R=\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha+1} \quad \text{and} \quad T=\frac{2\alpha}{\alpha+1}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

But this purely kinematical treatment only worked because of a dynamical fact that we didn't
emphasize. We assumed equality of the slopes, $s_1=s_2$, because waves don't like to have kinks. The
underlying dynamical reason for this, in the case of a wave on a string, is that a kink is pointlike, so the portion of the string
at the kink is infinitesimal in size, and therefore has essentially zero mass. If the transverse forces
acting on it differed by some finite amount, then its acceleration would be infinite, which is
not possible. The difference between the two forces is $Ts_1-Ts_2$, so $s_1=s_2$. But this
relies on the assumption that $T$ is the same on both sides of the boundary. Now this is true,
because we can't put different amounts of tension on two ropes that are tied together end to end.
Any excess tension applied to one tope is distributed equally to the other. For other types of
waves, however, we cannot make a similar argument, and therefore it need not be true that $s_1=s_2$.

A more detailed analysis shows that in general we have not $\alpha=v_2/v_1$ but
$\alpha=z_2/z_1$, where $z$ is a quantity called impedance which is defined for this purpose.
In a great many examples, as for the waves on a string, it is true that $v_2/v_1=z_2/z_1$, but
this is not a universal fact. Most of the exceptions are rather specialized and technical, such
as the reflection of light waves when the media have magnetic properties, but one fairly common
and important example is the case of sound waves, for which $z=\rho v$ depends not just on the
wave velocity $v$ but also on the density $\rho$. A practical example occurs in medical ultrasound
scans, where the contrast of the image is made possible because of the very large differences in
impedance between different types of tissue. The speed of sound in various tissues such as bone
and muscle varies by about a factor of 2, which is not a particularly huge factor, but there are
also large variations in density. The lung, for example, is basically a sponge or sack filled with
air. For this reason, the acoustic impedances of the tissues show a huge amount of variation,
with, e.g., $z_\zu{bone}/z_\zu{lung}\approx 40$.

<% end_sec('wave-reflection-impedance') %>

<% begin_sec("Inverted and uninverted reflections in general",nil,'wave-inversion-in-general') %>

For waves on a string, reflections back into a faster medium
are inverted, while those back into a slower medium are
uninverted. Is this true for all types of waves? The rather
subtle answer is that it depends on what property of the
wave you are discussing.

<% end_marg %>

Let's start by considering wave disturbances of freeway
traffic. Anyone who has driven frequently on crowded
freeways has observed the phenomenon in which one driver
taps the brakes, starting a chain reaction that travels
backward down the freeway as each person in turn exercises
caution in order to avoid rear-ending anyone. The reason why
this type of wave is relevant is that it gives a simple,
easily visualized example of how our description of a wave
depends on which aspect of the wave we have in mind. In
steadily flowing freeway traffic, both the density of cars
and their velocity are constant all along the road. Since
there is no disturbance in this pattern of constant velocity
and density, we say that there is no wave. Now if a wave is
touched off by a person tapping the brakes, we can either
describe it as a region of high density or as a region of
decreasing velocity.

The freeway traffic wave is in fact a good model of a sound
wave, and a sound wave can likewise be described either by
the density (or pressure) of the air or by its speed.
Likewise many other types of waves can be described by
either of two functions, one of which is often the
derivative of the other with respect to position.

Now let's consider reflections. If we observe the freeway
wave in a mirror, the high-density area will still appear
high in density, but velocity in the opposite direction will
now be described by a negative number. A person observing
the mirror image will draw the same density graph, but the
velocity graph will be flipped across the $x$ axis, and its
original region of negative slope will now have positive
slope. Although I don't know any physical situation that
would correspond to the reflection of a traffic wave, we can
immediately apply the same reasoning to sound waves, which
often do get reflected, and determine that a reflection can
either be density-inverting and velocity-noninverting or
density-noninverting and velocity-inverting.

This same type of situation will occur over and over as one
encounters new types of waves, and to apply the analogy we
need only determine which quantities, like velocity, become
negated in a mirror image and which, like density, stay the same.

A light wave, for instance, consists of a traveling pattern
of electric and magnetic fields. All you need to know in
order to analyze the reflection of light waves is how
electric and magnetic fields behave under reflection; you
don't need to know any of the detailed physics of electricity
and magnetism. An electric field can be detected, for
example, by the way one's hair stands on end. The direction
of the hair indicates the direction of the electric field.
In a mirror image, the hair points the other way, so the
electric field is apparently reversed in a mirror image. The
behavior of magnetic fields, however, is a little tricky.
The magnetic properties of a bar magnet, for instance, are
caused by the aligned rotation of the outermost orbiting
electrons of the atoms. In a mirror image, the direction of
rotation is reversed, say from clockwise to counterclockwise,
and so the magnetic field is reversed twice: once simply
because the whole picture is flipped and once because of the
reversed rotation of the electrons. In other words, magnetic
fields do not reverse themselves in a mirror image. We can
thus predict that there will be two possible types of
reflection of light waves. In one, the electric field is
inverted and the magnetic field 
uninverted (example \ref{eg:em-wave-refl-conductor}, p.~\pageref{eg:em-wave-refl-conductor}).
In the other,
the electric field is uninverted and the magnetic field inverted.

(a) Compute the amplitude of light that is reflected back into
air at an air-water interface, relative to the amplitude of
the incident wave. Assume that the light arrives in the direction
directly perpendicular to the surface.The speeds of light in air and water are
$3.0\times10^8$ and $2.2\times10^8$ m/s, respectively.\hwendpart
(b) Find the energy of the reflected wave as a fraction of
the incident energy.
