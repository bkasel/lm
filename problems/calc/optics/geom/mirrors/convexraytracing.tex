Draw a ray
diagram for the formation of an image by a convex mirror.
(a) How does the image's distance
from the mirror compare with the actual object's distance
from the mirror? From this comparison, determine whether the
magnification is greater than or less than one. (b) Is the
image real, or virtual? Could this mirror ever make the
other type of image?
