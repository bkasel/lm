(a) Find an expression, in natural units, for the velocity of a particle having mass $m$ and mass-energy $E$.\hwendpart
(b) Show that the units of your equation make sense.\hwendpart
(c) Your answer involves a square root, which could be either the positive or the negative root. Explain what this
represents physically, and why it makes sense.\hwendpart
(d) Discuss the limit of $E \gg m$, both mathematically and physically.\hwendpart
(e) Rewrite your expression in SI units. Don't rederive it from scratch. Simply determine how it needs to be
altered by inserting factors of $c$ in order to make the units work out in the SI.
