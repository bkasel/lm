(a) Show that when two velocities are combined
relativistically, and one of them equals the speed of light,
the result also equals the speed of light. \hwendpart
(b) Explain why
it has to be this way based on the principle of relativity.
(Note that it doesn't work to say that it has to be this way
because motion faster than $c$ is impossible. That isn't what
the principle of relativity says, and it also doesn't handle
the case where the velocities are in opposite directions.)
