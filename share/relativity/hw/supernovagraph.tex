(a) By measuring with a ruler on the graph in figure \figref{supernovae} on page \pageref{fig:supernovae},
estimate the $\mygamma$ values of the two supernovae.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Figure \figref{supernovae} gives the values of $v/c$. From these, compute $\mygamma$ values and
compare with the results from part a.\answercheck\hwendpart
