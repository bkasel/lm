(a) A spacecraft traveling at $1.0000\times10^7$ m/s
relative to the earth releases a probe in the forward
direction at a relative speed of $2.0000\times10^7$ m/s. How
fast is the probe moving relative to the earth? How does
this compare with the nonrelativistic result? \answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Repeat the
calculation, but with both velocities equal to $c/2$. How does
this compare with the nonrelativistic result?\answercheck
