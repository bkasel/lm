Make up a numerical example, in a particular frame
of reference, of two events  with
a spacelike interval between them. Make event 2 occur
after event 1. Now show by using a Lorentz transformation
that you can find another frame of reference in
which event 2 occurs before event 1.\\
\hwremark{To get from event 1 to event 2, or vice versa, you would
have to travel faster than light. Therefore there can't be a cause-and-effect
relationship between the two events, and it doesn't really matter which
one we consider to have happened first. On the other hand, if faster-than-light
travel was possible, then time travel paradoxes would be possible
in this kind of situation. For example, event 2 could be your birth, and
event 1 could be when you kill your own grandmother before she has any
children.}
