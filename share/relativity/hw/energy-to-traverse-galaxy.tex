(a) Let $L$ be the diameter of our galaxy. Suppose that a person in a spaceship of mass $m$ wants
to travel across the galaxy at constant speed, taking proper time $\tau$. Find the kinetic
energy of the spaceship. (b) Your friend is impatient, and wants to make the voyage in
an hour. For $L=10^5$ light years, estimate the energy in units of megatons of TNT
(1 megaton=$4\times10^9\ \junit$).
