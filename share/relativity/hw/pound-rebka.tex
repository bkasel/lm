(a) Calculate the Doppler shift to be expected in the Pound-Rebka experiment described on p.~\pageref{pound-rebka}.
(b) In the 1978 Iijima mountain-valley experiment (p.~\pageref{iijima}), analysis was complicated by the
clock's sensitivity to pressure, humidity, and temperature. A cleaner version of the experiment was done in
2005 by hobbyist Tom Van Baak. He put his 
kids and three of his atomic clocks in a minivan and drove from Bellevue, Washington to
a lodge on Mount Rainier, 1340 meters higher in elevation. They
spent the weekend there. Back at home, he compared the clocks
to others that had stayed at his house. 
Verify that the effect shown in the graph is as predicted by general relativity.
