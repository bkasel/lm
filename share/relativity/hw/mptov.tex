(a) Find a relativistic equation for the velocity of an
object in terms of its mass and momentum (eliminating $\mygamma$).
Work in natural units. \answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Show that your result is
approximately the same as the nonrelativistic value, $p/m$, at low
velocities. \hwendpart
(c) Show that very large momenta result in
speeds close to the speed of light.
