(a) A charged particle is surrounded by a uniform electric field.
Starting from rest, it is accelerated by the field to speed $v$ after
traveling a distance $d$. Now it is allowed to continue for a further
distance $3d$, for a total displacement from the start of $4d$.
What speed will it reach,
assuming newtonian physics?\hwendpart
(b) Find the relativistic result for the case of $v=c/2$.
