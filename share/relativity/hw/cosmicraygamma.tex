Cosmic-ray particles with relativistic velocities are
continually bombarding the earth's atmosphere. They are
protons and other atomic nuclei. Suppose a carbon nucleus
(containing six protons and six neutrons) arrives with an
energy of $10^{-7}$ J, which is unusually high, but not unheard
of. By what factor is its length shortened as seen by an
observer in the earth's frame of reference?
