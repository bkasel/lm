(a) Reexpress the Lorentz transformation equations 
using ordinary metric units where $c\ne1$. The point here is to practice the technique
for converting \emph{any} formula from natural units to metric units, by inserting
factors of $c$ wherever necessary in order to make the units make sense, as in the
examples \ref{eg:gamma-nat-mks} and \ref{eg:black-hole-natural} on page \pageref{eg:gamma-nat-mks}. That means
you shouldn't go back and redo the whole derivation from scratch.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Show that for speeds that are small compared to the speed of
light, these equations are identical to the Galilean equations.
