(a) Prove the equation $E^2-p^2=m^2$ for a material object,
where $E=m\mygamma$ is the total mass-energy. \hwendpart
(b) Using this result,
show that an object with zero mass must move at the speed of
light.\hwendpart
 (c) This equation can be applied more generally, to
light for instance.  Use it to find the momentum of a beam
of light having energy $E$. \answercheck\hwendpart
(d) Convert your answer from the
previous part into ordinary units.\answercheck\hwendpart
