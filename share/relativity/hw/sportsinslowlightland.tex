In Slowlightland, the speed of light is 20 mi/hr = 32 km/hr = 9 m/s. Think of an example of how
relativistic effects would work in sports. Things can get very complex very quickly, so try to think of a
simple example that focuses on just one of the following effects:
\begin{itemize}
 \item[] relativistic momentum
 \item[] relativistic addition of velocities
 \item[] time dilation and length contraction
 \item[] equivalence of mass and energy
 \item[] time it takes for light to get to an athlete
\end{itemize}
