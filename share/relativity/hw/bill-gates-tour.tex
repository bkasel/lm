Our sun lies at a distance of 26,000 light years from the center
of the galaxy, where there are some spectactular sights to see,
including a supermassive black hole that is rapidly eating up the
surrounding interstellar gas and dust. Rich tourist Bill Gates IV
buys a spaceship, and heads for the galactic core at a speed
of 99.99999\% of the speed of light.\\
(a) According to observers on Earth, how long does it take before
he gets back? (Ignore the short time he actually spends sightseeing
at the core.)\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) In Bill's frame of reference, how much time passes?\answercheck\hwendpart
(c) When you compare your answer to part b with the round-trip distance,
do you conclude that Bill considers himself to be moving faster than
the speed of light? If so, how do you reconcile this with
relativity? If not, then resolve the apparent paradox.
