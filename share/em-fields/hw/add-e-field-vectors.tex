Two electric fields, both lying in the $x$-$y$ plane, are superposed.
Field $\vc{E}_1$ has a magnitude of $35.24\ \zu{N}/\zu{C}$ and points
in the direction $217.3\degunit$ counterclockwise from the $x$ axis.
Field $\vc{E}_2$ has magnitude $48.01\ \zu{N}/\zu{C}$ and direction
$11.7\degunit$ counterclockwise from the $x$ axis.  Find the magnitude
and direction of the total field.\answercheck\hwendpart
