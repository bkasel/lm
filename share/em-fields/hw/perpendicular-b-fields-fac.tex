Suppose that, as in minilab \ref{lab:bar-magnet-b-vs-r} on p.~\pageref{lab:bar-magnet-b-vs-r}, we have a
known ambient magnetic field $\vc{B}_a$ at right angles to an field $\vc{B}_m$ whose magnitude is unknown.
When the two fields are superposed, we measure the direction of the total
field with a compass. Let $\theta$ be the (unsigned) angle by which the compass is deflected from
the direction of the ambient field. (a) Find the ratio of the magnitudes
$B_m/B_a$.

(b) Interpreting your answer from part a, show that it makes sense in the special cases
$\theta=0$, $45\degunit$, and $90\degunit$.
