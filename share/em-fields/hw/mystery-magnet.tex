Suppose we are given a permanent magnet with a
        complicated, asymmetric shape. Describe how a series of
        measurements with a magnetic compass could be used to
        determine the strength and direction of its magnetic field
        at some point of interest. Assume that you are only able to
        see the direction to which the compass needle settles; you
        cannot measure the torque acting on it.
