The gap between the electrodes in an automobile
        engine's spark plug is 0.060 cm.  To produce an electric
        spark in a gasoline-air mixture, an electric field of
        $3.0\times10^6$  V/m must be achieved.  On starting a car,
        what minimum voltage must be supplied by the ignition
        circuit? Assume the field is uniform.\answercheck\hwendpart
        (b) The small size
        of the gap between the electrodes is inconvenient because it
        can get blocked easily, and special tools are needed to
        measure it.  Why don't they design spark plugs with a wider gap?
