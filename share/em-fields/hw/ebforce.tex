A particle with a charge of 1.0 C and a mass of 1.0 kg is observed moving past point P
        with a velocity $(1.0\ \munit/\sunit)\hat{\vc{x}}$. The electric field at point P is
        $(1.0\ \zu{V}/\munit)\hat{\vc{y}}$, and the magnetic field is
        $(2.0\ \zu{T})\hat{\vc{y}}$. Find the force experienced by the particle.\answercheck
