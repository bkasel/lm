Consider the electric field created by an infinite
uniformly charged plane. Starting from the result of problem
8, show that the field at any point is $2\pi k\sigma$,
where $\sigma$ is the density of charge on the plane, in
units of coulombs per square meter. Note that the result is
independent of the distance from the plane. [Hint: Slice the
plane into infinitesimal concentric rings, centered at the
point in the plane closest to the point at which the field
is being evaluated. Integrate the rings' contributions to
the field at this point to find the total field.]
