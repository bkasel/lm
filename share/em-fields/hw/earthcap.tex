Find the capacitance of the surface of the
        earth, assuming there is an outer spherical ``plate'' at infinity.
        (In reality, this outer plate would just represent some distant
        part of the universe to which we carried away some of the earth's charge
        in order to charge up the earth.)\answercheck
