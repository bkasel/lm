Suppose someone proposes a new operation in which a vector $\vc{E}$ and
a scalar $B$ are added together to make a new vector $\vc{C}$ like this:
\begin{align*}
  C_x &= E_x + B \\
  C_y &= E_y + B \\
  C_z &= E_z + B 
\end{align*}
For example, we could do this using the electric field vector for $\vc{E}$,
and the magnitude of the magnetic field vector for $B$.
Prove that this operation won't be useful in physics, because it's not
rotationally invariant (sec.~\ref{subsec:rotational-invariance}, p.~\pageref{subsec:rotational-invariance}).
Note that this is a pure math problem requiring no knowledge of electricity and magnetism.
