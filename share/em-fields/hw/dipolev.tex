(a) Given that the on-axis field of a dipole at large distances is proportional to
        $D/r^3$, show that its potential
        varies as $D/r^2$. (Ignore positive and negative signs and
        numerical constants of proportion\-ality.)\hwendpart
        (b) Write down an exact expression for the potential of a two-charge dipole at an on-axis point,
        without assuming that the distance is large compared to the size
        of the dipole. Your expression will have to contain the actual
        charges and size of the dipole, not just its dipole moment. Now
        use approximations to show that, at large distances, this is consistent with
        your answer to part a.<% hw_hint("dipolev") %>
