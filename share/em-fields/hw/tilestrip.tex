(a) For the geometry described in example \ref{eg:twowires} on page \pageref{eg:twowires},
        find the field at a point the lies in the plane of the wires, but not between the wires,
        at a distance $b$ from the center line. 
        Use the same technique as in that example.\hwendpart
        (b) Now redo the calculation using the technique demonstrated on
        page \pageref{dipolestomakewire}. The integrals are nearly the same, but now the
        reasoning is reversed: you already know $\beta=1$, and you want to find an unknown
        field. The only difference in the integrals is that you are tiling a different
        region of the plane in order to mock up the currents in the two wires. Note that
        you can't tile a region that contains a point of interest, since the technique
        uses the field of a distant dipole.\answercheck
