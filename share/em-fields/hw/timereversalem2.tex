This problem is a more advanced exploration of the time-reversal ideas introduced
        in problem \ref{hw:timereversalem}.\\
        (a) In that problem, we assumed that charge did not flip
        its sign under time reversal. Suppose we make the opposite assumption, that
        charge \emph{does} change its sign. This is an idea introduced by Richard Feynman:
        that antimatter is really matter traveling backward in time! Determine the
        time-reversal properties of $\vc{E}$ and $\vc{B}$ under this new assumption,
        and show that $\der\vc{p}\propto\vc{E}\times\vc{B}$ is still valid under time-reversal.\\
        (b) Show that Maxwell's equations are time-reversal symmetric, i.e., that
        if the fields $\vc{E}(x,y,z,t)$ and $\vc{B}(x,y,z,t)$ satisfy
        Maxwell's equations, then so do  $\vc{E}(x,y,z,-t)$ and $\vc{B}(x,y,z,-t)$.
        Demonstrate this under both possible assumptions about charge, $q\rightarrow q$ and
        $q\rightarrow -q$.
