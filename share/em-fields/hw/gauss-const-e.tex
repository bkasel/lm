In a certain region of space, the electric field is constant (i.e.,
the vector always has the same magnitude and direction).
For simplicity, assume that the field points in the positive $x$
direction. (a) Use Gauss's law to prove that there is no charge
in this region of space. This is most easily done by considering
a Gaussian surface consisting of a rectangular box, whose edges
are parallel to the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes.\hwendpart
 (b) If there are
no charges in this region of space, what could be making this
electric field?
