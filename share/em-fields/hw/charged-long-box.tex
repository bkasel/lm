A rectangular box is uniformly charged with a charge density $\rho$.
The box is extremely long and skinny, and its cross-section is a square
with sides of length $b$. The length is so great in comparison to
$b$ that we can consider it as being infinite. Find the electric field at a
point lying on the box's surface, at the midpoint between the two edges.
Your answer will involve an integral that is most easily done using computer
software.
