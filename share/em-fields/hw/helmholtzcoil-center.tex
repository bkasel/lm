A Helmholtz coil is defined as a pair of identical
circular coils lying in parallel planes and
separated by a distance, $h$, equal to their
radius, $b$. Each coil has $N$ turns of wire.
 Current circulates in the same direction in each
coil, so the fields tend to reinforce each other in the
interior region. This configuration has the advantage of
being fairly open, so that other apparatus can be easily
placed inside and subjected to the field while remaining
visible from the outside. The choice of $h=b$ results in the
most uniform possible field near the center.
