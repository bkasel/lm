Consider the electric field created by a uniformly
charged cylinder that extends to infinity in one direction.
(a) Starting from the result of problem 8, show that the
field at the center of the cylinder's mouth is $2\pi k\sigma$,
 where $\sigma$ is the density of charge on
the cylinder, in units of coulombs per square meter. [Hint:
You can use a method similar to the one in problem 9.] (b)
This expression is independent of the radius of the
cylinder. Explain why this should be so. For example, what
would happen if you doubled the cylinder's radius?
