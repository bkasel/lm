A dipole has a midplane, i.e., the plane that cuts through the dipole's
        center, and is perpendicular to the dipole's axis.
        Consider a two-charge dipole made of point charges $\pm q$ located
        at $z=\pm\ell/2$. Use approximations to find the field at a distant
        point in the midplane, and show that its magnitude comes out to be 
        $kD/R^3$ (half what it would be at a point on the axis lying an equal distance
        from the dipole).
