In our by-now-familiar neuron, the voltage difference
        between the inner and outer surfaces of the cell membrane is
        about $V_{out}-V_{in}=-70\ \zu{mV}$ in the resting state, and the
        thickness of the membrane is about 6.0 nm (i.e., only about a
        hundred atoms thick).  What is the electric field inside the membrane?\answercheck
