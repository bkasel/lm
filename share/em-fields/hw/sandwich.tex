Two long, parallel strips of thin metal foil form a configuration like a long,
        narrow sandwich. The air gap between them has height $h$, the width of each
        strip is $w$, and their length is $\ell$. 
        Each strip carries current $I$, and we assume for concreteness that
        the currents are in opposite directions, so that the magnetic force, $F$, between
        the strips is repulsive.\hwendpart
        (a) Find the force in the limit of $w\gg h$.\answercheck\hwendpart
        (b) Find the force in the limit of $w\ll h$, which is like two ordinary wires.\hwendpart
        (c) Discuss the relationship between the two results.
