The first step in the proof of Amp\`{e}re's law on page \pageref{ampereproof}
        is to show that Amp\`{e}re's law holds in the case shown in figure
        \figref{ampereproof}/1, where a circular Amp\`{e}rian loop is
        centered on a long, straight wire that is perpendicular to the plane
        of the loop. Carry out this calculation, using the result 
        for the field of a wire that was established without using Amp\`{e}re's law.
