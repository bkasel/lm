Each figure represents the motion of a positively charged particle. The dots give the
        particles' positions at equal time intervals. In each case, determine
        whether the motion was caused by an electric force, a magnetic force,
        or a frictional force, and explain your reasoning. If possible, determine
        the direction of the magnetic or electric field. All fields are uniform.
        In (a), the particle stops for an instant at the upper right, but then
        comes back down and to the left, retracing the same dots.
        In (b), it stops on the upper right and stays there.
