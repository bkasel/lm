(a) In a series LC circuit driven by a DC voltage ($\omega=0$), compare the energy stored in
the inductor to the energy stored in the capacitor.\hwendpart
(b) Carry out the same comparison for an LC circuit that is oscillating freely (without any driving voltage).\hwendpart
(c) Now consider the general case of a series LC circuit driven by an oscillating voltage at an arbitrary
frequency. Let $\overline{U_L}$ and be the average energy stored in the inductor, and similarly for $\overline{U_C}$. Define
a quantity $u=\overline{U_C}/(\overline{U_L}+\overline{U_C})$, which can be interpreted as the capacitor's average share of the
energy, while $1-u$ is the inductor's average share. Find $u$ in terms of $L$, $C$, and $\omega$, and sketch
a graph of $u$ and $1-u$ versus $\omega$. What happens at resonance? Make sure your result is consistent with your answer
to part a.\answercheck\hwendpart
