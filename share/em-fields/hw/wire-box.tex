Four long wires are arranged, as shown, so that their
        cross-section forms a square, with connections at the ends
        so that current flows through all four before exiting.
        Note that the current is to the right in the two back wires,
        but to the left in the front wires. If the dimensions of the
        cross-sectional square (height and front-to-back) are $b$,
        find the magnetic field (magnitude and direction) along
        the long central axis.\answercheck
