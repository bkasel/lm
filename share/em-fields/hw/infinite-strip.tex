          (a) A rod of length $L$ is uniformly charged with charge $Q$.
          It can be shown by integration that the field at a point lying in the midplane of the rod
          at a distance $R$ is  $E =  k\lambda L/\left[R^2\sqrt{1+ L^2/4 R^2}\right]$, where $\lambda$
          is the charge per unit length. Show that this field

          (a) Show that the field found in example \ref{eg:chargedrodside} on page \pageref{eg:chargedrodside}

        reduces to $E=2k\lambda/R$ in the limit of $L\rightarrow\infty$.\hwendpart
        (b) An infinite strip of width $b$ has a surface charge density $\sigma$.
        Find the field at a point at a distance $z$ from the strip,
        lying in the plane perpendicularly bisecting the strip.

        (c) Show that this expression has the
        correct behavior in the limit where $z$ approaches zero,
        and also in the limit of $z\gg b$. For the latter, you'll need
        the result of problem \ref{hw:estrips}a, which is given
        on page \pageref{hwans:estrips}.
