Show that the magnitude of the electric field produced
by a simple two-charge dipole, at a distant point along the
dipole's axis, is to a good approximation proportional to
$D/r^3$, where $r$ is the distance from the dipole. [Hint:
Use the approximation $(1+\epsilon)^p\approx 1+p\epsilon$, which is valid for small $\epsilon $.]
