Consider the electric field created by a uniform ring of
total charge $q$ and radius $b$. (a) Show that the field at
a point on the ring's axis at a distance $a$ from the plane
of the ring is $kqa(a^2+b^2)^{-3/2}$. (b) Show that
this expression has the right behavior for $a=0$ and for $a$
much greater than $b$.
