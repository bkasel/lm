The circular parallel-plate capacitor shown in the figure is being charged
        up over time, with the voltage difference across the plates varying as
        $V=st$, where $s$ is a constant. The plates have radius $b$, and the distance
        between them is $d$. We assume $d \ll b$, so that the electric field between
        the plates is uniform, and parallel to the axis. Find the induced magnetic
        field at a point between the plates, at a distance $R$ from the axis.
