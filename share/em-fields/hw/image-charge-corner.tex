A point charge $q$ is situated in the empty space inside a corner formed
by two perpendicular half-planes made of sheets of metal. Let the sheets
lie in the $y$-$z$ and $x$-$z$ planes, so that the charge's distances
from the planes are $x$ and $y$. Both $x$ and $y$ are positive. The charge will
accelerate due to the electrostatic forces exerted by the sheets.
We wish to find the direction $\theta$ in which it will accelerate, expressed
as an angle counterclockwise from the negative $x$ axis, so that $0<\theta<\pi/2$.\\
(a) Determine as much as possible about the form of the answer based
on units.\hwendpart
(b) Find the full result for $\theta$.\hwendpart
