Refer to figure \figref{circularorbit} on page  \pageref{fig:circularorbit}. Electrons have the
type of charge I've been representing with light-colored spheres.\\
(a) As the electrons in the beam pass over the top of the circle,
what is the direction of the force on them? Use what you know about circular motion.\\
(b) From this information, use figure \figref{righthandrule}
on page \pageref{fig:righthandrule} to determine the direction of the magnetic field
(left, right, up, down, into the page, or out of the page).
