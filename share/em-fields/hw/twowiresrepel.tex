This problem is a continuation of problem \ref{hw:forcebetweentwowires}. Note that the
        answer to problem \ref{hw:forcebetweentwowires}b is given on page \pageref{hwans:forcebetweentwowires}.\hwendpart
        (a) Interchanging the 1's and 2's in the answer to problem \ref{hw:forcebetweentwowires}b,
        what is the magnitude of the magnetic force from wire 2 acting on wire 1? Is this consistent with
        Newton's third law?\hwendpart
        (b) Suppose the currents are in the same direction. Make a sketch, and use the
        right-hand rule to determine whether wire 1 pulls wire 2 towards it, or pushes it
        away.\hwendpart
        (c) Apply the right-hand rule again to find the direction of wire 2's force on
        wire 1. Does this agree with Newton's third law?\hwendpart
        (d) What would happen if wire 1's current was in the opposite direction compared
        to wire 2's?
