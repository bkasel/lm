A charged particle is released from rest. We see it start to move,
        and as it gets going, we notice that its path starts to curve. Can
        we tell whether this region of space has $\vc{E}\neq 0$, or $\vc{B}\neq 0$, or both?
        Assume that no other forces are present besides the possible electrical and magnetic ones,
        and that the fields, if they are present, are uniform.
