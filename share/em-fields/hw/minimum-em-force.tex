A charged particle is in motion at speed $v$, in a region of vacuum through which 
        an electromagnetic wave is passing. In what direction should the particle be moving in order
        to minimize the total force acting on it? Consider both possibilities for the
        sign of the charge. (Based on a problem by David J. Raymond.)
