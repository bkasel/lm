(a) At time $t=0$, a positively charged particle is
        placed, at rest, in a vacuum, in which there is
        a uniform electric field of magnitude
        $E$.  Write an equation giving the particle's speed, $v$, in terms of
        $t$, $E$, and its mass and charge $m$ and $q$.\answercheck\hwendpart
        (b) If this is done with two different objects and they are
        observed to have the same motion, what can you conclude
        about their masses and charges?  (For instance, when
        radioactivity was discovered, it was found that one form of
        it had the same motion as an electron in this type of experiment.)
