On page \pageref{curlxy}, the curl of $x\hat{\vc{y}}$ was computed.
        Now consider the fields $x\hat{\vc{x}}$ and $y\hat{\vc{y}}$.\hwendpart
        (a) Sketch these fields.\hwendpart
        (b) Using the same technique of explicitly constructing a small square,
        prove that their curls are both zero.
        Do not use the component form of the curl; this was one step in \emph{deriving}
        the component form of the curl.
