For a positively charged particle moving through a magnetic field,
        the directions of the $\vc{v}$, $\vc{B}$, and $\vc{F}$ vectors
        are related by a right-hand rule:
        \begin{align*}
                \vc{v}        & \quad \text{along the fingers, with the hand flat}\\
                \vc{B}        & \quad \text{along the fingers, with the knuckles bent}\\
                \vc{F}        & \quad \text{along the thumb}
        \end{align*}
        Make a three-dimensional model of the three vectors using
        pencils or rolled-up pieces of paper to represent the
        vectors assembled with their tails together. Make all three vectors
        perpendicular to each other. Now write down
        every possible way in which the rule could be rewritten by
        scrambling up the three symbols $\vc{v}$, $\vc{B}$, and $\vc{F}$. Referring
        to your model, which are correct and which are incorrect?
