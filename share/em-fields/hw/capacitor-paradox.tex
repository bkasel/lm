Resolve the following paradox. A capacitance $C$ is initially charged,
and is then connected to another capacitance $C$, forming a loop. With the
charge now shared equally, the energy is halved. If the connection is made
using wires that have finite resistance, then this energy loss could be
explained through resistive heating. But how is conservation of energy
satisfied if the resistance of the wires
is zero?
