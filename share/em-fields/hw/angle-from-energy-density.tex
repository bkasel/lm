Throughout this problem, we will use the standard notation $\rho$ (Greek letter rho,
which makes the ``r'' sound) for the energy density $\der U/\der v$.
Suppose that electric field vector $\vc{E}_1$ exists at a certain point
and creates an energy density $\rho$ there. Field $\vc{E}_2$ has the same
energy density $\rho$. When the two fields are superposed, the energy density
is $\alpha\rho$, where $\alpha$ is a unitless number. \\
(a) Find the angle between the two field vectors.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Check that your answer to part a makes sense in the special cases $\alpha=0$,
2, and 4.
