<% hw_solution %> Suppose two long, parallel wires are carrying
current $I_1$ and $I_2$. The currents may be either in the
same direction or in opposite directions. (a) Using the
information from section \ref{sec:calculating-magnetism}, determine under what
conditions the force is attractive, and under what
conditions it is repulsive. Note that, because of the
difficulties explored in problem \ref{hw:diverging-energy}, it's possible to
get yourself tied up in knots if you use the energy approach
of section \ref{sec:energy-in-fields}. (b) Starting from the result of problem \ref{hw:force-on-wire-in-b},
calculate the force per unit length.
