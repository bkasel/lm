(a) Find the parallel impedance of a $37\ \zu{k}\Omega$ resistor and
        a 1.0 nF capacitor at $f=1.0\times10^4$ Hz.\answercheck\hwendpart
        (b) A voltage with an amplitude of 1.0 mV drives this impedance at this
        frequency. What is the amplitude of the current drawn from the
        voltage source,  what is the current's phase angle with respect to the
        voltage, and does it lead the voltage, or lag behind it?\answercheck
