<% hw_solution %> (a) In the photo of the vacuum tube apparatus in figure \figref{circular-orbit}
on p.~\pageref{fig:circular-orbit}, infer the direction of the magnetic field from
the motion of the electron beam. (b) Based on your answer to
a, find the direction of the currents in the coils. (c) What
direction are the electrons in the coils going? (d) Are the
currents in the coils repelling or attracting the currents
consisting of the beam inside the tube? Compare with
figure \figref{magtwobody} on p.~\pageref{fig:magtwobody}.
