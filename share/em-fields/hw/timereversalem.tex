If you watch a movie played backwards, some vectors reverse their direction.
        For instance, people walk backwards, with their velocity vectors flipped around.
        Other vectors, such as forces, keep the same direction, e.g., gravity
        still pulls down. An electric field is another example of a vector that doesn't
        turn around: positive charges are still positive in the time-reversed
        universe, so they still make diverging electric fields, and likewise for
        the converging fields around negative charges. \hwendpart
        (a) How does the momentum of a material object behave under 
                time-reversal?<% hw_solution %>\hwendpart
        (b) The laws of physics are still valid in the time-reversed universe.
                For example, show that if two material objects are interacting, and
                momentum is conserved, then momentum is still conserved
                in the time-reversed universe.<% hw_solution %>\hwendpart

        (d) Similarly, show that the equation $\der\vc{p}\propto\vc{E}\times\vc{B}$ is still
                valid under time reversal.
