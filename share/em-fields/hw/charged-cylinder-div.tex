This is an alternative approach to problem \ref{hw:solidchargedcylinder},
        using a different technique.
        Suppose that a long cylinder contains a uniform charge
        density $\rho$ throughout its interior volume. \hwendpart
        (a) Use the methods of section \ref{sec:gaussdiff}
        to find the electric field inside the cylinder. \answercheck\hwendpart
        (b) Extend your solution to the outside region, using the same
        technique. Once you find the general form of the solution,
        adjust it so that the inside and outside fields match up at
        the surface.\answercheck
