<% hw_solution %> The purpose of this problem is to find the force
experienced by a straight, current-carrying wire running
perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field. (a) Let $A$ be
the cross-sectional area of the wire, $n$ the number of free
charged particles per unit volume, $q$ the charge per
particle, and $v$ the average velocity of the particles.
Show that the current is $I=Avnq$. (b) Show that the
magnetic force per unit length is $AvnqB$. (c)
Combining these results, show that the force on the wire per
unit length is equal to $IB$.
