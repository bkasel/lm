A hydrogen atom in a particular state has the charge density (charge per unit volume)
of the electron cloud given by $\rho=ae^{-br}z^2$, where $r$ is the distance from the
proton, and $z$ is the coordinate measured along the $z$ axis. Given that the total
charge of the electron cloud must be $-e$, find $a$ in terms of the other variables.
