Using a techniques similar to that of problem \ref{hw:divtrans},
        show that the divergence is rotationally invariant,
        in the special case of rotations about the $z$ axis.
        In such a rotation, we rotate to a new $(u,v,z)$
        coordinate system, whose axes are rotated by an angle
        $\theta $ with respect to those of the $(x,y,z)$ system. The
        coordinates are related by
        \begin{align*}
                        x  &=  u \cos  \theta  + v \sin  \theta   \\
                        y  &=  -u \sin  \theta  + v \cos  \theta   
        \end{align*}
        Find how the $u$ and $v$ components the field $\vc{E}$ depend on $u$
        and $v$, and show that its divergence is the same in this
        new coordinate system.
