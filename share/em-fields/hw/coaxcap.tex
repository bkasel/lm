(a) Use Gauss' law to find the fields inside and outside an
        infinite cylindrical surface with radius $b$ and uniform
        surface charge density $\sigma$.\answercheck\hwendpart
        (b) Show that there is a discontinuity in the electric field equal to $4\pi k \sigma$
        between one side of the surface and the other, as there should be (see page \pageref{e-discontinuity}).\hwendpart
         (c) Reexpress your result in terms of the charge per unit
         length, and compare with the field of a line of charge.\hwendpart
        (d) A coaxial cable has two conductors:
        a central conductor of radius $a$, and an outer conductor of
        radius $b$. These two conductors are separated by an insulator.
        Although such a cable is normally used for time-varying signals,
        assume throughout this problem that there is simply a DC voltage
        between the two conductors.
        The outer conductor is thin, as in part c. The inner
        conductor is solid, but, as is always the case with a conductor in electrostatics,
        the charge is concentrated on the surface. Thus, you can 
        find all the fields in part b by superposing the fields due
        to each conductor, as found in part c. (Note that on a given length of the cable,
        the total charge of the inner and outer conductors is zero, so $\lambda_1=-\lambda_2$,
        but $\sigma_1\ne\sigma_2$, since the areas are unequal.)
        Find the capacitance per unit length of such a cable.\answercheck
