The wires themselves in a circuit can have resistance,
        inductance, and capacitance. Would ``stray'' inductance and
        capacitance be most important for low-frequency or for
        high-frequency circuits? For simplicity, assume that the
        wires act like they're in \emph{series} with an inductor or capacitor.
