Electromagnetic waves are supposed to have their electric and magnetic fields
perpendicular to each other. (Throughout this problem, assume we're talking about
waves traveling through a vacuum, and that there is only a single sine wave traveling
in a single direction, not a superposition of sine waves passing through each other.)
Suppose someone claims they can make an electromagnetic wave in which the electric
and magnetic fields lie in the same plane. Prove that this is impossible based on
Maxwell's equations.
