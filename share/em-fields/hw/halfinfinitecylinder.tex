Consider the electric field created by a uniformly
        charged cylindrical surface that extends to infinity in one direction.\hwendpart
        (a) Show that the
        field at the center of the cylinder's mouth is $2\pi k\sigma$, 
        which happens to be the same as the field of an infinite \emph{flat}
        sheet of charge!\hwendpart
        (b) This expression is independent of the radius of the
        cylinder. Explain why this should be so. For example, what
        would happen if you doubled the cylinder's radius?
