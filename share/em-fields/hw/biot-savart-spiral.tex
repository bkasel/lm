Magnet coils are often wrapped in multiple layers. The figure shows the special case where the layers are all confined to a
single plane, forming a spiral. Since the thickness of the wires (plus their insulation) is fixed, the spiral that results is
a mathematical type known as an Archimedean spiral,\index{Archimedean spiral}\index{spiral!Archimedean} in which the turns are evenly spaced. The equation of the
spiral is $r=w\theta$, where $w$ is a constant. For a spiral that starts from $r=a$ and ends at $r=b$, show that the field
at the center is given by $(kI/c^2w)\ln b/a$.<% hw_solution %>
