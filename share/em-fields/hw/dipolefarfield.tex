This is a one-dimensional problem, with everything confined to
        the $x$ axis. Dipole A consists of a $-1.000$ C charge at $x=0.000$ m
        and a $1.000$ C charge at $x=1.000$ m. Dipole B has
        a $-2.000$ C charge at $x=0.000$ m
        and a $2.000$ C charge at $x=0.500$ m.\hwendpart
        (a) Compare the two dipole moments.\hwendpart
        (b) Calculate the field created by dipole A at $x=10.000$ m,
        and compare with the field dipole B would make. Comment on the
        result.\answercheck
