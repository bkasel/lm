        Use the Biot-Savart law to show that the magnetic field of a long, straight wire
        is 
        \begin{equation*}
                | B| = \frac{2 kI}{ c^2 R}\\

        Use the Biot-Savart law to derive the magnetic field of a long, straight wire,
        and show that this reproduces the result of example \ref{eg:bwire} on page \pageref{eg:bwire}.
