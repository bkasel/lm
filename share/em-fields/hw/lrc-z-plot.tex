A series LRC circuit consists of a 1.000 $\Omega$ resistor, a
        1.000 F capacitor, and a 1.000 H inductor. (These are
        not particularly easy values to find on the shelf at Radio Shack!)\hwendpart
        (a) Plot its impedance as a point in the complex plane for each of
        the following frequencies: $\omega$=0.250, 0.500, 1.000, 2.000, and 4.000 Hz.\hwendpart
        (b) What is the resonant angular frequency, $\omega_{res}$, 
        and how does this relate to your plot?\answercheck\hwendpart
        (c) What is the resonant frequency $f_{res}$ corresponding to your answer in part b?\answercheck
