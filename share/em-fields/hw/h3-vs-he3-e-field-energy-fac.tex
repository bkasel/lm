The nuclei ${}^3\zu{H}$ (hydrogen-3, or tritium) and ${}^3\zu{He}$ (helium-3)
have almost exactly the same size and shape, but helium-3's electric field
is twice as strong. (We'll see in ch.~\ref{ch:gauss-law} that this is a result of
its greater electric charge.) Compare the energies stored in the two fields.
