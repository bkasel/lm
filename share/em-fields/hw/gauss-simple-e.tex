(a) In a certain region of space, the electric field is given by
$\vc{E}=bx\hat{\vc{x}}$, where $b$ is a constant.
Find the amount of charge contained within a cubical volume extending
from $x=0$ to $x=a$, from $y=0$ to $y=a$, and from $z=0$ to $z=a$.\hwendpart
(b) Repeat for $\vc{E}=bx\hat{\vc{z}}$.\\
(c) Repeat for $\vc{E}=13bz\hat{\vc{z}}-7cz\hat{\vc{y}}$.\\
(d) Repeat for $\vc{E}=bxz\hat{\vc{z}}$.
