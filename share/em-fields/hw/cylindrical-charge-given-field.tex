An electric field is given in cylindrical coordinates $(R,\phi,z)$ by $E_R=ce^{-u|z|}R^{-1}\cos^2\phi$, where
the notation $E_R$ indicates the component of the field pointing directly away from the axis, and
the components in the other directions are zero. (This isn't a completely impossible expression for
the field near a radio transmitting antenna.) (a) Find the total charge enclosed within the
infinitely long cylinder extending from the axis out to $R=b$. (b) Interpret the $R$-dependence of
your answer to part a.
