The purpose of this problem is to find how the gain of a transformer
        depends on its construction.\hwendpart
        (a) The number of loops of wire, $N$, in a solenoid is changed, 
        while keeping the length constant. How does the impedance
        depend on $N$? State your answer as a proportionality,
        e.g., $Z\propto N^3$ or $Z\propto N^{-5}$.\hwendpart
        (b) For a given AC voltage applied across the inductor, how does the
        magnetic field depend on $N$?
        You need to take into account both the dependence of a solenoid's field on $N$ for a
        given current and your answer to part a, which affects the current.\hwendpart
        (c) Now consider a transformer consisting of two solenoids. The input
        side has $N_1$ loops, and the output $N_2$. We wish to find how the
        output voltage $V_2$ depends on $N_1$, $N_2$, and the input voltage
        $V_1$. The text has already established $V_2\propto V_1N_2$, so it only
        remains to find the dependence on $N_1$. Use your result from part b
        to accomplish this. The ratio $V_2/V_1$ is called the voltage gain.
