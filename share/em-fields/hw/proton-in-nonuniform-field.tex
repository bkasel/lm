A proton is in a region in which the electric field is
        given by $E=a+bx^3$. If the proton starts at rest at
        $x_1=0$, find its speed, $v$, when it reaches position
        $x_2$. Give your answer in terms of $a$, $b$, $x_2$, and $e$
        and $m$, the charge and mass of the proton.\answercheck
