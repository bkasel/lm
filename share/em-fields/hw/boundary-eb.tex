On page \pageref{fig:permeability-boundary}, I proved that $\vc{H}_{\parallel,1}=\vc{H}_{\parallel,2}$
  at the boundary between two substances if there is no free current and the fields are static. In fact, each of Maxwell's
  four equations implies a constraint with a similar structure. Some are constraints on the field components parallel
  to the boundary, while others are constraints on the perpendicular parts. Since some of the fields referred to in Maxwell's
  equations are the electric and magnetic fields $\vc{E}$ and $\vc{B}$, while others are the auxiliary fields $\vc{D}$ and $\vc{H}$,
  some of the constraints deal with  $\vc{E}$ and $\vc{B}$, others with $\vc{D}$ and $\vc{H}$. Find the other three constraints.
