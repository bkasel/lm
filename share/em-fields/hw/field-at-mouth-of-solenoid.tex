<% hw_solution %> In section \ref{sec:calculating-magnetism} I gave an equation for the magnetic
field in the interior of a solenoid, but that equation
doesn't give the right answer near the mouths or on the
outside. Although in general the computation of the field in
these other regions is complicated, it is possible to find a
precise, simple result for the field at the center of one of
the mouths, using only symmetry and vector addition. What is it?
