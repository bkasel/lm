(a) Prove that in an electromagnetic plane wave, half the energy
        is in the electric field and half in the magnetic field.\hwendpart
(b) Based on your result from part a, find the proportionality
constant in the relation $\der\vc{p}\propto\vc{E}\times\vc{B}\der v$,
where $\der \vc{p}$ is the momentum of the part of a plane light wave
contained in the volume $\der v$. The vector $\vc{E}\times\vc{B}$,
multiplied by the appropriate constant, is known as the Poynting
vector, and even outside the context of an electromagnetic plane wave,
it can be interpreted as a momentum density or rate of
energy flow. (To do this problem, you need to know the relativistic
relationship between the energy and momentum of a beam of
light from problem \ref{hw:ultrarelativistic} on p.~\pageref{hw:ultrarelativistic}.)\index{Poynting vector}\answercheck
