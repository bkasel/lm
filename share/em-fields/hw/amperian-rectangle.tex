Verify Amp\`{e}re's law in the case shown in the figure, assuming the known equation for
the field of a wire. A wire carrying current $I$ passes perpendicularly through the center of the rectangular
Amp\`{e}rian surface. The length of the rectangle is infinite, so it's not necessary to
compute the contributions of the ends.
