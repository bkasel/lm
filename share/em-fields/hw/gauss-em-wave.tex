Light is a wave made of electric and magnetic fields, and the
fields are perpendicular to the direction of the wave's motion, i.e.,
they're transverse. An example would be the electric
field given by $\vc{E}=b \hat{\vc{x}} \sin cz$, where $b$ and $c$
are constants. (There would also be an associated magnetic field.)
We observe that light can travel through a vacuum, so we expect that
this wave pattern is consistent with the nonexistence of any
charge in the space it's currently occupying. Use Gauss's law
to prove that this is true.
