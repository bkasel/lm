The following data give the results of three experiments in which charged particles
        were released from the same point in space, and the forces on them were measured:

        \begin{tabular}{lll}
                $q_1=1\ \zu{C}\:,$ & $\vc{v}_1=0\:,$ & $\vc{F}_1=(1\ \zu{N})\hat{\vc{y}}$\\
                $q_2=1\ \zu{C}\:,$ & $\vc{v}_2=(1\ \munit/\sunit)\hat{\vc{x}}\:,$ & $\vc{F}_2=(1\ \zu{N})\hat{\vc{y}}$\\
                $q_3=1\ \zu{C}\:,$ & $\vc{v}_3=(1\ \munit/\sunit)\hat{\vc{z}}\:,$ & $\vc{F}_3=0$\\
        \end{tabular}
