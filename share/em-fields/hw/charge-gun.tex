A hollow cylindrical pipe has length $\ell$ and radius $b$. Its ends are open, but on the curved
surface it has a charge density $\sigma$. A charge $q$ with mass $m$ is released at the center
of the pipe, in unstable equilibrium. Because the equilibrium is unstable, the particle acclerates
off in one direction or the other, along the axis of the pipe, and comes shooting out like a bullet
from the barrel of a gun. Find the velocity of the particle when it's infinitely far from the ``gun.''
Your answer will involve an integral that is difficult to do by hand;
you may want to look it up in a table of integrals, do it online at
integrals.com, or download and install the free Maxima symbolic math
software from maxima.sourceforge.net.
