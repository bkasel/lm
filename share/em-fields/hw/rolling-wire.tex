A U-shaped wire makes electrical contact with a second, straight wire, which rolls along it to the
right,
as shown in the figure. The whole thing is immersed in a uniform magnetic field, which is
perpendicular to the plane of the circuit. The resistance of the rolling wire is much
greater than that of the U.\\
(a) Find the direction of the force on the wire based on conservation of energy.\hwendpart
(b) Verify the direction of the force using right-hand rules.\hwendpart
(c) Find magnitude of the force acting on the wire.
 There is more than one way to do this, but please
do it using Faraday's law (which works even though it's the
Amp\`{e}rian surface itself that is changing, rather than the field).\answercheck\hwendpart
(d) Consider how the answer to part a would have changed if the direction of the field had been
reversed, and also do the case where the direction of the rolling wire's motion is reversed.
Verify that this is in agreement with your answer to part c.
