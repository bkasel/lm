In an article on the SARS epidemic, the May 7, 2003 New
York Times discusses conflicting estimates of the disease's
incubation period (the average time that elapses from
infection to the first symptoms). ``The study estimated it
to be 6.4 days. But other statistical calculations ...
showed that the incubation period could be as long as 14.22
days.'' What's wrong here?
