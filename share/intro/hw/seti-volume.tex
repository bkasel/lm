Radio was first commercialized around 1920, and ever since then, radio signals from our
planet have been spreading out across our galaxy. It is possible that alien civilizations
could detect these signals and learn that there is life on earth. In the 90 years that
the signals have been spreading at the speed of light, they have created a sphere with a radius of 90 light-years.
To show an idea of the size of this sphere, I've indicated it in the figure as a tiny white circle on an image
of a spiral galaxy seen edge on. (We don't have similar photos of our own Milky Way galaxy, because we can't
see it from the outside.) So far we haven't received answering signals from aliens within this sphere,
but as time goes on, the sphere will expand as suggested by the dashed outline, reaching more and more stars that might harbor extraterrestrial
life. Approximately what year will it be when the sphere has expanded to fill a volume 100 times greater than
the volume it fills today in 2010?
