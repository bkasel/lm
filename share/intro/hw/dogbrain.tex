Assume a dog's brain is twice as great in diameter as a
cat's, but each animal's brain cells are the same size and
their brains are the same shape. In addition to being a far
better companion and much nicer to come home to, how many
times more brain cells does a dog have than a cat?
The answer is not 2.
