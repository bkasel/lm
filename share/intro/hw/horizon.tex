The distance to the horizon is given by the expression $\sqrt{2rh}$, where $r$ is the
radius of the Earth, and $h$ is the observer's height above the Earth's surface. (This can
be proved using the Pythagorean theorem.) Show that the units of this expression make
sense. Don't try to prove the result, just check its units.
