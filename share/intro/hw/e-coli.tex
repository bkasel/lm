(a) Using the microscope photo in the figure, estimate the mass of a one cell of the
\emph{E. coli} bacterium, which is one of the most common ones in the human
intestine. Note the scale at the lower right corner, which is 1 $\mu\munit$. Each of
the tubular objects in the column is one cell.
(b) The feces in the human intestine are mostly bacteria (some dead, some alive),
of which \emph{E. coli} is a large and typical component. Estimate the number of bacteria
in your intestines, and compare with the number of human cells in your body, which is
believed to be roughly on the order of $10^{13}$. (c) Interpreting your result from part b,
what does this tell you about the size of a typical human cell compared to the size of
a typical bacterial cell?
