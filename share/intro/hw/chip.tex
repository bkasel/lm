In a computer memory chip, each bit of information (a 0
or a 1) is stored in a single tiny circuit etched onto the
surface of a silicon chip. The circuits cover the surface of
the chip like lots in a housing development. A typical chip
stores 64 Mb (megabytes) of data, where a byte is 8 bits.
Estimate (a) the area of each circuit, and (b) its linear size.
