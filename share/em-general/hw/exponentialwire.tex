Suppose that at some instant in time, a wire extending from $x=0$ to $x=\infty$ holds a charge density, in units of coulombs per meter,
        given by $ae^{-bx}$. This type of charge density, $\der q/\der x$, is typically notated as $\lambda$ (Greek letter lambda). Find the total
        charge on the wire.\answercheck
