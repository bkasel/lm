A helium atom finds itself momentarily in this
        arrangement.  Find the direction and magnitude of the force
        acting on the right-hand electron.  The two protons in the
        nucleus are so close together ($\sim1$ fm) that you can
        consider them as being right on top of each other.
m4_ifelse(__sn,1,[::],[:As discussed in chapter \ref{ch:atom}, the
charge of an electron is $-e$, and the charge of a proton $e$,
where $e=1.60\times10^{-19}\ \zu{C}$.:])
