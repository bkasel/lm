        Suppose you are holding your hands in front of you, 10 cm apart.\hwendpart
        (a) Estimate the total number of electrons in each hand.\answercheck\hwendpart
        (b) Estimate the total repulsive force of all the electrons
        in one hand on all the electrons in the other.\answercheck\hwendpart
        (c) Why don't you feel your hands repelling each other?\hwendpart
        (d) Estimate how much the charge of a proton could differ in
        magnitude from the charge of an electron without creating a
        noticeable force between your hands.
