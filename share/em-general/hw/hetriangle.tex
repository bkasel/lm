The helium atom of problem \ref{hw:heline} has some new experiences,
        goes through some life changes, and later on finds itself in
        the configuration shown here.  What are the direction and
        magnitude of the force acting on the bottom electron?  (Draw
        a sketch to make clear the definition you are using for the
        angle that gives direction.)\answercheck
