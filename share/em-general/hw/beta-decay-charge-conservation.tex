The nuclear process of beta decay by electron capture
is described parenthetically on p.~\pageref{electroncapture}. The reaction is
$\text{p}+\text{e}^- \rightarrow  \text{n}+\nu $. (a) Show that charge is conserved in this
reaction.\hwendpart
 (b) Explain why electron capture doesn't occur in
hydrogen atoms. (If it did, matter wouldn't exist!)<% hw_solution %>
