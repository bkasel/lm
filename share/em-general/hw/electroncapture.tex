The nuclear process of beta decay by electron capture
        is described parenthetically on page \pageref{electroncapture}. The reaction is
        $\zu{p}+\zu{e}^- \rightarrow \zu{n}+\nu$.\hwendpart
        (a) Show that charge is conserved in this
        reaction. \hwendpart
        (b) Conversion between energy and mass is
        discussed in chapter \ref{ch:rel}. Based on
        these ideas, explain why electron capture doesn't occur in
        hydrogen atoms. (If it did, matter wouldn't exist!)
