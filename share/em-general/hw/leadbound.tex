        As discussed in more detail in section \ref{sec:nucleus}, a nucleus contains
        protons, which have positive charge, and neutrons, which have zero charge.
        If only the electrical force existed, a nucleus would immediately fly apart
        due to electrical repulsion. However, there is also another force, called the
        strong nuclear force, which keeps this from happening.

        Suppose that a proton in a lead nucleus wanders out to
        the surface of the nucleus, and experiences a strong nuclear
        force of about 8 kN from the nearby neutrons and protons
        pulling it back in.  Compare this numerically to the
        repulsive electrical force from the other protons, and
        verify that the net force is attractive.  A lead nucleus is
        very nearly spherical, 
        is about 6.5 fm in radius, and
        contains 82 protons, each with a charge of $+e$, where
        $e=1.60\times10^{-19}\ \zu{C}$.
