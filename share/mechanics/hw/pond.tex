A rock is dropped into a pond. Draw plots of its position
versus time, velocity versus time, and acceleration versus
time. Include its whole motion, starting from the moment it
is dropped, and continuing while it falls through the air,
passes through the water, and ends up at rest on the bottom of the pond.
Do your work on a photocopy or a printout of
