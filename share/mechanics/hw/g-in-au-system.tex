Astronomers calculating orbits of planets often work in a nonmetric system of
        units, in which the unit of time is the year, the unit of mass is the sun's mass,
        and the unit of distance is the
        astronomical unit (A.U.), defined as half the long axis of the earth's orbit.
        In these units, find an exact expression for the gravitational constant, $G$.\answercheck
