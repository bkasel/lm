A ball rolls down the ramp shown in the figure,
consisting of a curved knee, a straight slope, and a curved
bottom. For each part of the ramp, tell whether the ball's
velocity is increasing, decreasing, or constant, and also
whether the ball's acceleration is increasing, decreasing,
or constant. Explain your answers. Assume there is no air
friction or rolling resistance. m4_ifelse(__me,0,[:Hint: Try problem \ref{hw:two-ramps} first.
