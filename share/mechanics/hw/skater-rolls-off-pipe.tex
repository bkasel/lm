<% hw_solution %> A skateboarder starts at rest nearly at the top of a
giant cylinder, and begins rolling down its side. (If he
started exactly at rest and exactly at the top, he would
never get going!) Show that his board loses contact with the
pipe after he has dropped by a height equal to one third
the radius of the pipe.
