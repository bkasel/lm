The figure shows a demonstration performed by Otto von Guericke for Emperor Ferdinand III,
in which two teams of horses failed to pull apart a pair of hemispheres from which the
air had been evacuated. (a) What object makes the force that holds the hemispheres together?
(b) The hemispheres are in a museum in Berlin, and have a diameter of 65 cm. What is the
amount of force holding them together? (Hint: The answer would be the same if they were
cylinders or pie plates rather then hemispheres.)
