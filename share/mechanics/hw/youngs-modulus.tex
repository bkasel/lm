(a) Using the solution of problem \ref{hw:combine-springs}, which is given
in the back of the book, predict how the spring constant of
a fiber will depend on its length and cross-sectional area.\hwendpart

(b) The constant of proportionality is called the \index{Young's
modulus}Young's modulus, $E$, and typical values of the
Young's modulus are about $10^{10}$  to $10^{11}$. What
units would the Young's modulus have in the SI (meter-kilogram-second) system? <% hw_solution %>
