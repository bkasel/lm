A $20.0\ \zu{g}$ cockroach is lounging at a distance $r=5.00\ \zu{cm}$
from the axis of the carousel of a microwave oven. Except for the species, the situation is similar
to the one shown in the figure. The cockroach's
angular coordinate is
$\theta(t) = 12t^2 - 4.0t^3$, where $t$ is in seconds and
$\theta$ is in radians.\\
%
(a) Find the angular velocity and acceleration.\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(b) At what time $t_2 > 0$ is the cockroach at rest? At what time
$t_1$, where $0 < t_1 < t_2$, is the cockroach moving the fastest?\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(c) Find the tangential and radial components of the \emph{linear}
acceleration of the cockroach at $t_1$. What is the direction of
the acceleration vector at this time?\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(d) How many revolutions does the cockroach make from $t=0$ to $t =
t_2$?\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(e) Suppose that the carousel, instead of decelerating, had kept spinning at
constant speed after $t_1$. Find the period and the frequency (in revolutions per minute).\answercheck
