        A certain mass, when hung from a certain spring, causes the spring to stretch
        by an amount $h$ compared to its equilibrium length.
        If the mass is displaced vertically from this equilibrium, it will oscillate
        up and down with a period $T_{osc}$. Give a numerical comparison between
        $T_{osc}$ and $T_{fall}$, the time required for the mass to fall from rest
        through a height $h$, when it isn't attached to the spring.
