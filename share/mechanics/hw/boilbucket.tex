Let $E_b$ be the energy required to boil one kg of water.
(a) \answercheck
 Find an equation for the minimum height from which a
bucket of water must be dropped if the energy released on
impact is to vaporize it. Assume that all the heat goes into
the water, not into the dirt it strikes, and ignore the
relatively small amount of energy required to heat the water
from room temperature to $100\degcunit$. [Numerical check, not
for credit: Plugging in $E_b=2.3$ MJ/kg should give a result
of 230 km.]\hwendpart
 (b) Show that the units of your answer in part a
come out right based on the units given for $E_b$.
