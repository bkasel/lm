(a) Let $\theta $ be the latitude of a point on the
Earth's surface.  Derive an algebra equation for the
distance, $L$, traveled by that point during one rotation of
the Earth about its axis, i.e., over one day, expressed in
terms of $\theta$ and $R$, the radius of the earth.
You may find it helpful to draw one or more diagrams in the style
of figure \figref{tomato} on p.~\pageref{fig:tomato}.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Generalize the result of problem \ref{hw:earth-stepwise-equator}a to
points not necessarily on the equator.\answercheck\hwendpart
(c) Check the units of your equation using the method shown in example \ref{eg:checking-units}
on p.~\pageref{eg:checking-units}.\hwendpart
(d) Check that your equation in part b gives zero for the North Pole, and also that
it agrees with problem \ref{hw:earth-stepwise-equator}a in the special case of a point
on the equator.\hwendpart
(e) At what speed is Fullerton, California, at latitude 
$\theta=34\degunit$, moving with the rotation of the Earth about its
axis?\answercheck\hwendpart
