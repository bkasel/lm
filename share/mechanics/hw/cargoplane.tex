A cargo plane has taken off from a tiny airstrip in the
        Andes, and is climbing at constant speed, at an angle of
        $\theta=17\degunit$ with respect to horizontal.  Its engines supply a
        thrust of $F_{thrust}=200\ \zu{kN}$, and the lift from its wings is
        $F_{lift}=654\ \zu{kN}$.  Assume that air resistance (drag) is
        negligible, so the only forces acting are thrust, lift, and
        weight.  What is its mass, in kg?
