<% hw_solution %> (a) The ball is released at the top of the ramp
shown in the figure. Friction is negligible. Use physical
reasoning to draw $v-t$ and $a-t$ graphs. Assume that the
ball doesn't bounce at the point where the ramp changes
slope. (b) Do the same for the case where the ball is rolled
up the slope from the right side, but doesn't quite have
enough speed to make it over the top.
