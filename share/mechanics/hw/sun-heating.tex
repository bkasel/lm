The sun is mainly a mixture of hydrogen and helium, some of which is
ionized. As a simplified model, let's pretend that it's made purely out
of neutral, monoatomic hydrogen. Given its mass, it would then contain $1.2\times10^{57}$ atoms.
It generates energy from nuclear reactions at a rate of $3.8\times10^{26}\ \zu{W}$,
and it is in a state of equilibrium in which this amount of energy is radiated off
into space as light. Suppose that its ability to radiate light were somehow blocked.
Find the rate at which its temperature would increase.
