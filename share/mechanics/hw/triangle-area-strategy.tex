Suppose that you are given vectors $\vc{u}$ and $\vc{v}$, their components
being specified in three dimensions. These vectors describe two sides of
a triangle, and you want to find the triangle's area. This can be done using
only the operation of the dot product, or using only the cross product.
Outline both methods, and comment on which is more efficient.
