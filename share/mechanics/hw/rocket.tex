\answercheck The graph shows the force, in meganewtons, exerted
by a rocket engine on the rocket as a function of time. If
the rocket's mass is 4000 kg, at what speed is the rocket
moving when the engine stops firing? Assume it goes straight
up, and neglect the force of gravity, which is much
less than a meganewton.
