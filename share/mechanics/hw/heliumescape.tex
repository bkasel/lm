In the earth's atmosphere, the molecules are constantly
moving around. Because temperature is a measure of kinetic
energy per molecule, the average kinetic energy of each type
of molecule is the same, e.g., the average KE of the $\zu{O}_2$
molecules is the same as the average KE of the $\zu{N}_2$
molecules. (a) If the mass of an $\zu{O}_2$ molecule is eight
times greater than that of a He atom, what is the ratio of
their average speeds? Which way is the ratio, i.e., which is
typically moving faster? (b) Use your result from part a to
explain why any helium occurring naturally in the atmosphere
has long since escaped into outer space, never to return.
(Helium is obtained commercially by extracting it from rocks.)
You may want to do problem \ref{hw:escape-velocity} first,
for insight.\answercheck
