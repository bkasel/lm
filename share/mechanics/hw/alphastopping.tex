A uranium atom deep in the earth spits out an alpha
particle. An alpha particle is a fragment of an atom. This
alpha particle has initial speed $v$, and travels a distance
$d$ before stopping in the earth.\hwendpart

 (a) Find the force, $F$, from the dirt
that stopped the particle, in terms of $v,d$, and its mass,
$m$. Don't plug in any numbers yet. Assume that the force
was constant.\answercheck\hwendpart

 (b) Show that your answer has the right units.\hwendpart

(c) Discuss how your answer to part a depends on all three
variables, and show that it makes sense. That is, for each
variable, discuss what would happen to the result if you
changed it while keeping the other two variables constant.
Would a bigger value give a smaller result, or a bigger
result? Once you've figured out this \emph{mathematical}
relationship, show that it makes sense \emph{physically}.\hwendpart

(d) Evaluate your result for $m=6.7\times10^{-27}$  kg,
$v=2.0\times10^4$  km/s, and $d=0.71$ mm.\answercheck\hwendpart
