The figure shows a block acted on by two external forces, each of magnitude $F$.
One of the forces is horizontal, but the other is applied at a downward angle $\theta$.
Gravity is negligible compared to these forces. The block rests on a
surface with friction described by a coefficient of friction $\mu_s$.
(a) Find the minimum value of $\mu_s$ that is required if the block is to remain
at rest.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Show that this expression has the correct limit as $\theta$ approaches zero.
