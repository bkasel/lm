A bar of mass $m$ and length $L$ is supported by a hinge on one end
and by a rope on the other end. The rope makes an angle $\theta$ with
respect to the horizontal. In addition, a weight $W$ is hung from the bar at a
distance $x$ away from the hinge. Take the $+x$ direction to the
right, and $+y$ vertically upwards.\\
