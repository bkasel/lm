(a) Let $W$ be the amount of work done by friction in the first
cycle of oscillation, i.e., the amount of energy lost to
heat. Find the fraction of the original energy $E$ that
remains in the oscillations after $n$ cycles of motion.

(b) From this, prove the equation
\begin{equation*}
  \left(1-\frac{W}{E}\right)^Q = e^{-2\pi}
\end{equation*}
(recalling that the number
535 in the definition of $Q$ is $e^{2\pi}$).

(c) Use this to prove the approximation $1/Q\approx(1/2\pi )W/E$.
(Hint: Use the approximation $\ln (1+x)\approx x$, which is valid
for small values of $x$, as shown on p.~\pageref{math-approx-exp-and-log}.)
