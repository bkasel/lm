Let $t$ be the time that has elapsed since the Big Bang. In that time, one would imagine that light, traveling at speed
$c$, has been able to travel a maximum distance $ct$. (In fact the distance is several times more than this, because
according to Einstein's theory of general relativity, space itself has been expanding while the ray of light was
in transit.) The portion of the universe that we can observe
would then be a sphere of radius $ct$, with volume $v=(4/3)\pi r^3=(4/3)\pi(ct)^3$. Compute the rate
$\der v/\der t$ at which the volume of the observable universe is increasing, and check that your answer has the right
