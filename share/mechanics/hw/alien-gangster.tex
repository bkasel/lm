(a) A certain vile alien gangster lives on the
surface of an asteroid, where his weight is 0.20 N. He
decides he needs to lose weight without reducing his
consumption of princesses, so he's going to move to a
different asteroid where his weight will be 0.10 N. The
real estate agent's database has asteroids listed by mass,
however, not by surface gravity. Assuming that all asteroids
are spherical and have the same density, how should the mass
of his new asteroid compare with that of his old one?\hwendpart

 (b)
Jupiter's mass is 318 times the Earth's, and its gravity is
about twice Earth's. Is this consistent with the results of
part a? If not, how do you explain the discrepancy?<% hw_solution %>
