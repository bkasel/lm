If an object starts accelerating from rest, we have
$v^2=2a\Delta x$ for its speed after it has traveled a
distance $\Delta x$. Explain in words why it makes sense
that the equation has velocity squared, but distance only to
the first power. Don't recapitulate the derivation in the
book, or give a justification based on units. The point is
to explain what this feature of the equation tells us about
the way speed increases as more distance is covered.
