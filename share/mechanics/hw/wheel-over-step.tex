(a) Find the minimum horizontal force which, applied at
the axle, will pull a wheel over a step. Invent algebra
symbols for whatever quantities you find to be relevant, and
give your answer in symbolic form. [Hints: There are four
forces on the wheel at first, but only three when it lifts
off. Normal forces are always perpendicular to the surface
of contact. Note that the corner of the step cannot be
perfectly sharp, so the surface of contact for this force
really coincides with the surface of the wheel.]\hwendpart
(b) Under what circumstances does your result become
infinite? Give a physical interpretation.
