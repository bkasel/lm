A massless rod of length $\ell$ has weights, each of mass $m$, attached to its ends. The rod is initially put in
a horizontal position, and laid on an off-center fulcrum located at a distance $b$ from the rod's center. The rod will
topple. (a) Calculate the total gravitational torque on the rod directly, by adding the two torques.
(b) Verify that this gives the same result as would have been obtained by taking the entire gravitational
force as acting at the center of mass.
