The sun turns on its axis once every 26.0 days. Its mass
is $2.0\times10^{30}$ kg and its radius is $7.0\times10^8$ m.
Assume it is a rigid sphere of uniform density.\\
(a) What is the sun's angular momentum? \answercheck\hwendpart
In a few billion years, astrophysicists predict that the sun
will use up all its sources of nuclear energy, and will
collapse into a ball of exotic, dense matter known as a
white dwarf. Assume that its radius becomes $5.8\times10^6$ m
(similar to the size of the Earth.) Assume it does not lose
any mass between now and then. (Don't be fooled by the
photo, which makes it look like nearly all of the star was
thrown off by the explosion. The visually prominent gas
cloud is actually thinner than the best laboratory vacuum
ever produced on earth. Certainly a little bit of mass is
actually lost, but it is not at all unreasonable to make an
approximation of zero loss of mass as we are doing.)\\
