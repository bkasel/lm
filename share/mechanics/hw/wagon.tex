A wagon is being pulled at constant speed up a slope $\theta$
        by a rope that makes an angle $\phi$ with the vertical. (a)
        Assuming negligible friction, show that the tension in the
        rope is given by the equation
        \begin{equation*}
                T = \frac{\sin\theta}{\sin(\theta+\phi)}mg,
        \end{equation*}\hwendpart
        (b)
        Interpret this equation in the special cases of $\phi=0$ and
        $\phi=180\degunit-\theta$.<% hw_solution %>
