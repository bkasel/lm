Consider the following passage from Alice in Wonderland,
in which Alice has been falling for a long time down a rabbit hole:

Down, down, down. Would the fall \emph{never} come to an
end? ``I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?''
she said aloud. ``I must be getting somewhere near the
center of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand
miles down, I think'' (for, you see, Alice had learned
several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom,
and though this was not a \emph{very} good opportunity for
showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to
her, still it was good practice to say it over)...

Alice doesn't know much physics, but let's try to calculate
the amount of time it would take to fall four thousand
miles, starting from rest with an acceleration of 10
$\ \munit/\sunit^2$. This is really only a lower limit; if there really
was a hole that deep, the fall would actually take a longer
time than the one you calculate, both because there is air
friction and because gravity gets weaker as you get deeper
(at the center of the earth, $g$ is zero, because the earth
is pulling you equally in every direction at once).
