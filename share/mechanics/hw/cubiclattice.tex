This problem depends on the results of problems problem \ref{hw:springsseries}
        on page \pageref{hw:springsseries} and
        problem \ref{hw:youngmodulus} from this chapter. When atoms
        form chemical bonds, it makes sense to talk about the spring
        constant of the bond as a measure of how ``stiff'' it is. Of
        course, there aren't really little springs --- this is just a
        mechanical model. The purpose of this problem is to estimate
        the spring constant, $k$, for a single bond in a typical piece
        of solid matter. Suppose we have a fiber, like a hair or a
        piece of fishing line, and imagine for simplicity that it is
        made of atoms of a single element stacked in a cubical
        manner, as shown in the figure, with a center-to-center
        spacing $b$. A typical value for $b$ would be about $10^{-10}\ \munit$.\hwendpart
        (a) Find an equation for $k$ in terms of $b$, and in terms of
        the Young's modulus, $E$, defined in problem \ref{hw:youngmodulus} and its
        solution. \hwendpart
        (b) Estimate $k$ using the numerical data given in
        problem \ref{hw:youngmodulus}. \hwendpart
        (c) Suppose you could grab one of the atoms in a
        diatomic molecule like $\zu{H}_2$ or $\zu{O}_2$, and let the other atom hang
        vertically below it. Does the bond stretch by any
        appreciable fraction due to gravity?
