<% hw_solution %> A cargo plane has taken off from a tiny airstrip in
the Andes, and is climbing at constant speed, at an angle of
$\theta =17\degunit$ with respect to horizontal.  Its engines
supply a thrust of $F_\text{thrust}=200$ kN, and the lift from
its wings is $F_\text{lift}=654$ kN.  Assume that air resistance
(drag) is negligible, so the only forces acting are thrust,
lift, and weight.  What is its mass, in kg?
