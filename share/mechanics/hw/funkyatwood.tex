In the system shown in the figure, the pulleys on the
        left and right are fixed, but the pulley in the center can
        move to the left or right. The two hanging masses are identical,
        and the pulleys and ropes are all massless.
        Find the upward acceleration of the mass on the left, in terms
        of $g$ only.
