The potential energy of a particle moving
in a certain one-dimensional region of space is
\begin{multline*}
  U(x) = (1.00\ \junit/\munit^4) x^4 - (4.00\ \junit/\munit^2) x^2 \\ + (1.00\ \junit/\munit) x.
\end{multline*}
You might want to plot the function $U(x)$ using
a graphing calculator or an online utility such as desmos.com.
An object of mass $2.00\ \kgunit$ is released from rest at
$x = 2.00\ \munit$. \\
