Some fleas can jump as high as 30 cm. The flea only has
a short time to build up speed --- the time during which its
center of mass is accelerating upward but its feet are still
in contact with the ground. Make an order-of-magnitude
estimate of the acceleration the flea needs to have while
straightening its legs, and state your answer in units of
$g$, i.e., how many ``$g$'s it pulls.'' (For comparison,
fighter pilots black out or die if they exceed about 5 or 10 $g$'s.)
