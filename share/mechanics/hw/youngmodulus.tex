(a) Using the solution of problem \ref{hw:springsseries}
        on page \pageref{hw:springsseries}, predict how the spring constant of
        a fiber will depend on its length and cross-sectional area.\hwendpart
        (b) The constant of proportionality is called the Young's
        modulus, $E$, and typical values of the Young's modulus are
        about $10^{10}$ to $10^{11}$. What units would the Young's modulus
        have in the SI system?
