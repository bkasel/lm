Blocks $M_1$ and $M_2$ are stacked as shown, with $M_2$ on top. $M_2$
is connected by a string to the wall, and $M_1$ is pulled to the
right with a force $F$ big enough to get $M_1$ to
move. The coefficient of kinetic friction has the same value $\mu_k$ among all surfaces
(i.e., the block-block and ground-block interfaces).\\
