A certain binary star system consists of two stars with
masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, separated by a distance $b$. A
comet, originally nearly at rest in deep space, drops into
the system and at a certain point in time arrives at the
midpoint between the two stars. For that moment in time,
find its velocity, $v$, symbolically in terms of $b$, $m_1$,
$m_2$, and fundamental constants.
