A cannon standing on a flat field fires a cannonball
with a muzzle velocity $v$, at an angle $\theta $ above
horizontal. The cannonball thus initially has velocity
components $v_x=v \cos  \theta $ and $v_y=v \sin \theta $.\hwendpart
 %
(a) Show that the cannon's range (horizontal distance to
where the cannonball falls) is given by the equation $R=(2v^2/g)\sin\theta\cos\theta$ .\hwendpart
 %
(b) Interpret your equation in the cases of $\theta =0$
and $\theta =90\degunit$.<% hw_solution %>
