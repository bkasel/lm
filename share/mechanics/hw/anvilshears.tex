 Some garden shears are like a pair of scissors: one sharp
blade slices past another. In the ``anvil'' type, however, a
sharp blade presses against a flat one rather than going
past it. A gardening book says that for people who are not
very physically strong, the anvil type can make it easier to
cut tough branches, because it concentrates the force on one
side. Evaluate this claim based on Newton's laws. [Hint:
Consider the forces acting on the branch, and the motion of the branch.]
