The figure shows a see-saw with two springs at
Codornices Park in Berkeley, California. Each spring has
spring constant $k$, and a kid of mass $m$ sits on each
seat. (a) Find the period of vibration in terms of the
variables $k$, $m$, $a$, and $b$. (b) Discuss the special case
where $a=b$, rather than $a>b$ as in the real see-saw. (c)
Show that your answer to part a also makes sense in the case of $b=0$.
