In an 18th-century naval battle, a cannon ball is shot
horizontally, passes through the side of an enemy ship's
hull, flies across the galley, and lodges in a bulkhead.
Draw plots of its horizontal position, velocity, and
acceleration as functions of time, starting while it is
inside the cannon and has not yet been fired, and ending
when it comes to rest. There is not any significant amount
of friction from the air. Although the ball may rise and
fall, you are only concerned with its horizontal motion, as seen from above.
