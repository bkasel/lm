A rail gun is a device like a train on a track, with
the train propelled by a powerful electrical pulse. Very
high speeds have been demonstrated in test models, and rail
guns have been proposed as an alternative to rockets for
sending into outer space any object that would be strong
enough to survive the extreme accelerations. Suppose that
the rail gun capsule is launched straight up, and that the
force of air friction acting on it is given by 
$F=be^{-cx}$, where $x$ is the altitude, $b$ and $c$ are
constants, and $e$ is the base of natural logarithms. The
exponential decay occurs because the atmosphere gets thinner
with increasing altitude. (In reality, the force would
probably drop off even faster than an exponential, because
the capsule would be slowing down somewhat.) Find the amount
of kinetic energy lost by the capsule due to air friction
between when it is launched and when it is completely beyond
the atmosphere. (Gravity is negligible, since the air
friction force is much greater than the gravitational force.)
