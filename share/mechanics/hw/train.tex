Lionel brand toy trains come with sections of track in
standard lengths and shapes. For circular arcs, the most
commonly used sections have diameters of 662 and 1067 mm at
the inside of the outer rail. The maximum speed at which a
train can take the broader curve without flying off the
tracks is 0.95 m/s. At what speed must the train be operated
to avoid derailing on the tighter curve?\answercheck
