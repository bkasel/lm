(a) A mass $m$ is hung from a spring whose spring constant is $k$. Write down
        an expression for the total interaction energy of the system, $U$, and find its equilibrium
        position.<% hw_hint("hangfromspring") %>\hwendpart
        (b) Explain how you could use your result from part a to determine an unknown
        spring constant.
