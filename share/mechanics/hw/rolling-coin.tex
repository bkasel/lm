When we release an object such as a bicycle wheel or a coin on an inclined plane, we can observe
a variety of different behaviors. Characterize these behaviors empirically and try to list the physical
parameters that determine which behavior occurs. Try to form a conjecture about the behavior
using simple closed-form expressions. Test your conjecture experimentally.
