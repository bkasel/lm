The figure shows a trap door of length $\ell$, which is released at rest
from a horizontal position and swings downward under its own weight.
The bug stands at a distance $b$ from the hinge. Because the bug feels
the floor dropping out from under it with some acceleration, it feels
a change in the apparent acceleration of gravity from $g$ to some value
$g_a$, at the moment when the door is released. Find $g_a$.\answercheck
