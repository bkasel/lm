When you buy a helium-filled balloon, the seller has to inflate it
        from a large metal cylinder of the compressed gas. The helium inside
        the cylinder has energy, as can be demonstrated for example by releasing
        a little of it into the air: you hear a hissing sound, and that sound
        energy must have come from somewhere. The total amount of energy in the
        cylinder is very large, and if the valve is inadvertently damaged or broken off,
        the cylinder can behave like a bomb or a rocket.
        
        Suppose the company that puts the gas in the cylinders prepares cylinder A with
        half the normal amount of pure helium, and cylinder B with the normal amount.
        Cylinder B has twice as much energy, and yet the temperatures of both cylinders
        are the same. Explain, at the atomic level, what form of energy is involved,
        and why cylinder B has twice as much.
