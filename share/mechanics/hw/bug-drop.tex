A bug stands at the right end of a rod of length $\ell$, which is
initially at rest in a horizontal position. The rod rests on a fulcrum
which is at a distance $b$ to the left of the rod's center, so that
when the rod is released from rest, the bug's end will drop.
For what value of $b$ will the bug experience apparent
weightlessness at the moment when the rod is released?\answercheck
