<% hw_solution %> Prove, based on Newton's laws of motion and Newton's
law of gravity, that all falling objects have the same
acceleration if they are dropped at the same location on the
earth and if other forces such as friction are unimportant.
Do not just say, ``$g=9.8\ \munit/\sunit^2$ -- it's constant.''  You
are supposed to be \emph{proving} that $g$ should be the
same number for all objects.
