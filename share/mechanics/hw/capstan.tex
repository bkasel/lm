The photo shows a coil of rope wound around a smooth metal post.
A large amount of tension is applied at the bottom of the coil,
but only a tiny force, supplied by a piece of sticky tape,
is needed at the top to keep the rope from slipping. Show that the
ratio of these two forces increases exponentially with the number
of turns of rope, and find an expression for that ratio.<% hw_hint("capstan") %>\answercheck
