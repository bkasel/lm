A person of mass $m$ stands on the ball of one foot. Find
the tension in the calf muscle and the force exerted by the
shinbones on the bones of the foot, in terms of $m$, $g$, $a$, and $b$.
For simplicity, assume that all the forces are at 90-degree
angles to the foot, i.e., neglect the angle between the foot
and the floor.\answercheck
