<% hw_solution %> The big difference between the equations for momentum and kinetic energy
is that one is proportional to $v$ and one to $v^2$. Both, however, are proportional
to $m$. Suppose someone tells you that there's a third quantity, funkosity, defined
as $f=m^2v$, and that funkosity is conserved. How do you know your leg is being pulled?
