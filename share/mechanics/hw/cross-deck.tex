<% hw_solution %>  Our full discussion of two- and three-dimensional
motion is postponed until the second half of the book, but
here is a chance to use a little mathematical creativity in
anticipation of that generalization. Suppose a ship is
sailing east at a certain speed $v$, and a passenger is
walking across the deck at the same speed $v$, so that his
track across the deck is perpendicular to the ship's
center-line. What is his speed relative to the water, and in
what direction is he moving relative to the water?
