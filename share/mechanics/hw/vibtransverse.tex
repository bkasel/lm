The equilibrium length of each spring in the figure is $b$, so when the mass $m$ 
        is at the center, neither spring exerts any force on it. When the mass is
        displaced to the side, the springs stretch; their spring constants are both $k$.\hwendpart
        (a) Find the energy, $U$, stored in the springs, as a function of $y$, the distance
        of the mass up or down from the center.\answercheck\hwendpart
        (b) Show that the period of small up-down oscillations is infinite.
