The figure shows the path followed by Hurricane Irene in 2005 as it moved north. The dots show the
location of the center of the storm at six-hour intervals, with lighter dots at
the time when the storm reached its greatest intensity. Find the time when the
storm's center had a velocity vector to the northeast and an acceleration vector
to the southeast. Explain.
