<% hw_solution %> The figure shows a view from above of a collision
about to happen between two air hockey pucks sliding without
friction. They have the same speed, $v_i$, before the
collision, but the big puck is 2.3 times more massive than
the small one. Their sides have sticky stuff on them, so
when they collide, they will stick together. At what angle
will they emerge from the collision? In addition to giving
a numerical answer, please indicate by drawing on the figure
how your angle is defined.
