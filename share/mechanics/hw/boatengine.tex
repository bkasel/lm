Experiments show that the power consumed by a boat's
engine is approximately proportional to the third power of its
speed. (We assume that it is moving at constant speed.) (a)
When a boat is crusing at constant speed, what type of
energy transformation do you think is being performed? (b)
If you upgrade to a motor with double the power, by what
factor is your boat's crusing speed increased? [Based on a
problem by Arnold Arons.] <% hw_solution %>
