For an astronaut
sealed inside a space suit, getting rid of body heat can be
difficult. Suppose an astronaut is performing vigorous
physical activity, expending 200 watts of power. An energy
of 200 kJ is enough to raise her body temperature by $1\degcunit$.
If none of
the heat can escape from her space suit, how long will it
take before her body temperature rises by $6\degcunit$
($11\degunit\textup{F}$), an amount  sufficient to kill her?
