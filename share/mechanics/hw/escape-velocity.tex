\answercheck Starting at a distance $r$ from a planet of mass $M$, how
fast must an object be moving in order to have a hyperbolic
orbit, i.e., one that never comes back to the planet? This
velocity is called the escape velocity. Interpreting the
result, does it matter in what direction the velocity is?
Does it matter what mass the object has? Does the object
escape because it is moving too fast for gravity to act on it?
