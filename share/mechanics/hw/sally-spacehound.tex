While escaping from the palace of the evil Martian
emperor, Sally Spacehound jumps from a tower of height $h$
down to the ground. Ordinarily the fall would be fatal, but
she fires her blaster rifle straight down, producing an
upward force of magnitude $F_B$. This force is insufficient to levitate
her, but it does cancel out some of the force of gravity.
During the time $t$ that she is falling, Sally is unfortunately
exposed to fire from the emperor's minions, and can't dodge
their shots. Let $m$ be her mass, and $g$ the strength of
gravity on Mars.\hwendpart
