A tugboat of mass $m$ pulls a ship of mass $M$,
accelerating it. The speeds are low enough that you can
ignore fluid friction acting on their hulls, although there
will of course need to be fluid friction acting on
the tug's propellers.\hwendpart
 %
(a) Analyze the forces in which the tugboat participates,
using a table in the format shown in m4_ifelse(__problems,1,[:section \ref{sec:newton-2-analysis-of-forces}:],[:__subsection_or_section(analysis-of-forces):]). Don't
worry about vertical forces.\hwendpart
 %
(b) Do the same for the ship.\hwendpart
 %
(c) If the force acting on the tug's
propeller is $F$, what is the tension, $T$, in the cable
connecting the two ships? [Hint: Write down two equations,
one for Newton's second law applied to each object. Solve
these for the two unknowns $T$ and $a$.]\answercheck\hwendpart

(d) Interpret your answer in the special cases of $M=0$ and $M=\infty$.
