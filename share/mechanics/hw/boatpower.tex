Experiments show that the power consumed by a boat's
        engine is approximately proportional to the third power of its
        speed. (We assume that it is moving at constant speed.)\hwendpart
         (a)
        When a boat is cruising at constant speed, what type of
        energy transformation do you think is being performed? \hwendpart
        (b)
        If you upgrade to a motor with double the power, by what
        factor is your boat's maximum cruising speed increased?
