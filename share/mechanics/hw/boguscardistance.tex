Find the error in the following calculation. A student
wants to find the distance traveled by a car that accelerates
from rest for 5.0 s with an acceleration of $2.0\ \munit/\sunit^2$.
First he solves $a=\Delta v/\Delta t$ for $\Delta v=10 \ \munit/\sunit$.
Then he multiplies to find $(10\ \munit/\sunit)(5.0\ \sunit)=50\ \munit$. Do not
just recalculate the result by a different method; if that
was all you did, you'd have no way of knowing which
calculation was correct, yours or his.
