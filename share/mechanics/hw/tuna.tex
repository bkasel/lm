The figure shows the motion of a bluefin tuna, as measured by
a radio tag (Block et al., Nature, v. 434, p. 1121, 2005), over the course
of several years. Until this study, it had been believed that the populations
of the fish in the eastern and western Atlantic were separate, but this 
particular fish was observed to cross the entire Atlantic Ocean, from Virginia
to Ireland. Points A, B, and C show a period of one month, during which the
fish made the most rapid progress. Estimate its speed during that month,
in units of kilometers per hour.\answercheck
