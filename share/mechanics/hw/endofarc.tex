A toy car is released on one side of a piece of track
that is bent into an upright $U$ shape. The car goes back
and forth. When the car reaches the limit of its motion on
one side, its velocity is zero. Is its acceleration also
zero? Explain using a $v-t$ graph. [Based on a problem
by Serway and Faughn.]
