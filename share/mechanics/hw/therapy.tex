A physical therapist wants her patient to rehabilitate
his injured elbow by laying his arm flat on a table, and
then lifting a 2.1 kg mass by bending his elbow. In this
situation, the weight is 33 cm from his elbow. He calls her
back, complaining that it hurts him to grasp the weight. He
asks if he can strap a bigger weight onto his arm, only 17
cm from his elbow. How much mass should she tell him to use
so that he will be exerting the same torque? (He is raising
his forearm itself, as well as the weight.) \answercheck
