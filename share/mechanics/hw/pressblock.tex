 Your hand presses a block of mass $m$ against a wall
with a force $\vc{F}_H$ acting at an angle $\theta $, as shown in the figure. Find the
minimum and maximum possible values of $|\vc{F}_H|$ that can keep
the block stationary, in terms of $m$, $g$, $\theta$, and
$\mu_s$, the coefficient of static friction between
the block and the wall. Check both your answers in the case of
$\theta=90\degunit$, and interpret the case where the maximum force is infinite.\answercheck
