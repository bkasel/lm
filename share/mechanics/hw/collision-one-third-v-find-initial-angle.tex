Two equal masses travel at equal speeds and collide in a perfectly
inelastic collision. The final velocity of the two masses is 1/3
the initial speed. What was the angle between
the velocity vectors of the two masses when they collided? (Give
an exact expression, not a decimal approximation.)\answercheck
