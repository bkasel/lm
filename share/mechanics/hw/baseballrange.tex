A batter hits a baseball at speed
        $v$, at an angle $\theta$ above horizontal.\hwendpart
        (a) Find an equation for the range (horizontal distance to
        where the ball falls), $R$, in terms of the relevant variables. Neglect air friction
        and the height of the ball above the ground when it is hit.

        (b) Interpret your equation in the cases of $\theta$=0 and $\theta=90\degunit$.\hwendpart
        (c) Find the angle that gives the maximum range.<% hw_answer %>
