<% hw_solution %>  The figure shows the motion of a point on the rim of
a rolling wheel. (The shape is called a cycloid.) Suppose
bug A is riding on the rim of the wheel on a bicycle that is
rolling, while bug B is on the spinning wheel of a bike
that is sitting upside down on the floor. Bug A is moving
along a cycloid, while bug B is moving in a circle. Both
wheels are doing the same number of revolutions per minute.
Which bug has a harder time holding on, or do they find
it equally difficult?
