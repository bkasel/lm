Example \ref{eg:tractor} on page \pageref{eg:tractor} describes a force-doubling
setup involving a pulley. Make up a more complicated
arrangement, using two pulleys, that would multiply
the force by four. The basic idea is to take the output
of one force doubler and feed it into the input of a second one.
