Two springs with spring constants $k_1$ and $k_2$ are put together end-to-end. Let
        $x_1$ be the amount by which the first spring is stretched relative to
        its equilibrium length, and similarly for $x_2$. If the combined double
        spring is stretched by an amount $b$ relative to \emph{its} equilibrium
        length, then $b=x_1+x_2$. Find the spring constant, $K$, of the combined
        spring in terms of $k_1$ and $k_2$.
