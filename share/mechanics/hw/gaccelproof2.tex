On page \pageref{gaccelproof}, I used the chain rule to prove that the acceleration
        of a free-falling object is given by $a=-g$. In this problem, you'll use a different
        technique to prove the same thing. Assume that the acceleration is a constant,
        $a$, and then integrate to find $v$ and $y$, including appropriate constants of
        integration. Plug your expressions for $v$ and $y$ into the equation for
        the total energy, and show that $a=-g$ is the only value that results in constant
        energy.
