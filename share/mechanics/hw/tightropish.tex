(a) For the apparatus shown in the figure, find the equilibrium angle $\theta$
        in terms of the two masses.\answercheck\hwendpart
        (b) Interpret your result in the case of $M\gg m$ ($M$ much greater than $m$). Does
        it make sense physically?\hwendpart
        (c) For what combinations of masses would your result give nonsense? Interpret
        this physically.
