Driving down a hill inclined at an angle $\theta $ with
respect to horizontal, you slam on the brakes to keep from
hitting a deer. Your antilock brakes kick in, and you don't skid.\hwendpart
 %
 (a) Analyze the forces. (Ignore rolling
resistance and air friction.)\hwendpart

 (b) Find the car's maximum
possible deceleration, $a$ (expressed as a positive number),
in terms of $g$, $\theta$, and the relevant coefficient of
friction.\answercheck\hwendpart

 (c) Explain physically why the car's mass has no
effect on your answer.\hwendpart

 (d) Discuss the mathematical behavior
and physical interpretation of your result for negative
values of $\theta $.\hwendpart
 %
 (e) Do the same for very large positive
values of $\theta $.
