<% hw_solution %>  Three cyclists in a race are rounding a semicircular
curve. At the moment depicted, cyclist A is using her brakes
to apply a force of 375 N to her bike.  Cyclist B is
coasting.  Cyclist C is pedaling, resulting in a force of
375 N on her bike.  Each cyclist, with her bike, has a
mass of 75 kg.  At the instant shown, the instantaneous
speed of all three cyclists is 10 m/s.  On the diagram, draw
each cyclist's acceleration vector with its tail on top of
her present position, indicating the directions and lengths
reasonably accurately.  Indicate approximately the
consistent scale you are using for all three acceleration
vectors.  Extreme precision is not necessary as long as the
directions are approximately right, and lengths of vectors
that should be equal appear roughly equal, etc.  Assume all
three cyclists are traveling along the road all the time,
not wandering across their lane or wiping out and going off the road.
