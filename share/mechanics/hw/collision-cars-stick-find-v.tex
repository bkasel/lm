A $1000\ \kgunit$ car approaches an intersection traveling north at
$20.0\ \munit/\sunit$. A $1200\ \kgunit$ car approaches the same
intersection traveling east at $22.0\ \munit/\sunit$. The two cars
collide at the intersection and lock together. The drivers probably
wish it was all over now, but they're still moving. What is the
velocity of the cars immediately after the collision?\answercheck
