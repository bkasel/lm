The figure shows a stack of two blocks, sitting on top of a table that is bolted to the floor.
All three objects are made from identical wood, with their surfaces finished identically using
the same sandpaper. We tap the middle block, giving it an initial velocity $v$ to the right.
The tap is executed so rapidly that almost no initial velocity is imparted to the top block.\hwendpart
%
(a) Find the time that will elapse until the slipping between the top and middle blocks stops.
Express your answer in terms of $v$, $m$, $M$, $g$, and the relevant coefficient of friction.\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(b) Show that your answer makes sense in terms of units.\hwendpart
%
(c)  Check that your result has the correct behavior when you
  make $m$ bigger or smaller. Explain. This means that you should
  discuss the mathematical behavior of the result, and then explain
  how this corresponds to what would really happen physically.\hwendpart
%
  (d) Similarly, discuss what happens when you make $M$ bigger or smaller.\hwendpart
%
  (e) Similarly, discuss what happens when you make $g$ bigger or smaller.
