Continuing problem \ref{hw:ladderwarmup}, find an equation for
$\phi $ in terms of $\theta $, and show that $m$ and $L$ do
not enter into the equation. Do not assume any numerical
values for any of the variables. You will need the trig
identity $\sin (a-b)=\sin a \cos b - \sin b \cos a$.
(As a numerical check on your result, you may wish to
check that the angles given in part b of the previous
problem satisfy your equation.)
