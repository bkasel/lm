\answercheck In one of his more flamboyant moments, Galileo wrote
``Who does not know that a horse falling from a height of
three or four cubits will break his bones, while a dog
falling from the same height or a cat from a height of eight

be the fall of a grasshopper from a tower or the fall of an
ant from the distance of the moon.'' Find the speed of an
ant that falls to earth from the distance of the moon at the

is released from a point that is not actually near the moon,
so the moon's gravity is negligible.
You will need the result of example \ref{eg:pe-grav} on p.~\pageref{eg:pe-grav}.
