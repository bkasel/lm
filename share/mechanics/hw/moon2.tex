Suppose that on a certain day there is a crescent moon,
and you can tell by the shape of the crescent that the
earth, sun and moon form a triangle with a $135\degunit$ interior
angle at the moon's corner. What is the magnitude of the
total gravitational force of the earth and the sun on the moon?
(If you haven't done problem \ref{hw:eclipse} already, you might
want to try it first, since it's easier, and some of its results
can be recycled in this problem.)
