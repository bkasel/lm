You are considering going on a space voyage to Mars, in
        which your route would be half an ellipse, tangent to the
        Earth's orbit at one end and tangent to Mars' orbit at the
        other. Your spacecraft's engines will only be used at the
        beginning and end, not during the voyage. How long would the
        outward leg of your trip last? (m4_ifelse(__sn,1,[:The orbits of Earth and Mars are nearly circular, and Mars's is bigger by a factor of 1.52.:],[:Assume the orbits of Earth
        and Mars are circular.:])) \answercheck
