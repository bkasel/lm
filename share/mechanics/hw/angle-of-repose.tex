The angle of repose is the maximum slope on which an
object will not slide. On airless, geologically inert bodies
like the moon or an asteroid, the only thing that determines
whether dust or rubble will stay on a slope is whether the
slope is less steep than the angle of repose.

are the relevant variables.\hwendpart

 (b) On an asteroid, where $g$
can be thousands of times lower than on Earth, would rubble
be able to lie at a steeper angle of repose?<% hw_solution %>
