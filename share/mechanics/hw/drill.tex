A machinist is drilling holes in a piece of aluminum
according to the plan shown in the figure. She starts with
the top hole, then moves to the one on the left, and then to
the one on the right. Since this is a high-precision job,
she finishes by moving in the direction and at the angle
that should take her back to the top hole, and checks that
she ends up in the same place. What are the distance and
direction from the right-hand hole to the top one?\answercheck\hwendpart
