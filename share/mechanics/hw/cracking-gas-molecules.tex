A sample of gas is enclosed in a sealed chamber. The gas consists of
molecules, which are then split in half through some process such as
exposure to ultraviolet light, or passing an electric spark through the
gas. The gas returns to thermal equilibrium with the surrounding
room. How does its pressure now compare with its pressure before the
molecules were split?
