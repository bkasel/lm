A physics homework question asks, ``If you start from
rest and accelerate at 1.54 $\ \munit/\sunit^2$ for 3.29 s, how far do
you travel by the end of that time?'' A student answers as follows:
\begin{equation*}
            1.54 \times 3.29  =  5.07\ \munit
\end{equation*}
His Aunt Wanda is good with numbers, but has never taken
physics. She doesn't know the formula for the distance
traveled under constant acceleration over a given amount of
time, but she tells her nephew his answer cannot be
right. How does she know?
