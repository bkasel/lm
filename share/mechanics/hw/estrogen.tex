In the last century, the average age of the onset of
puberty for girls has decreased by several years. Urban
folklore has it that this is because of hormones fed to beef
cattle, but it is more likely to be because modern girls
have more body fat on the average and possibly because of
estrogen-mimicking chemicals in the environment from the
breakdown of pesticides. A hamburger from a hormone-implanted
steer has about 0.2 ng of estrogen (about double the amount
of natural beef). A serving of peas contains about 300 ng of
estrogen. An adult woman produces about 0.5 mg of estrogen
per day (note the different unit!). (a) How many hamburgers
would a girl have to eat in one day to consume as much
estrogen as an adult woman's daily production? (b) How
many servings of peas? \answercheck
