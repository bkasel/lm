(a) Let $\theta $ be the latitude of a point on the
Earth's surface.  Derive an algebra equation for the
distance, $L$, traveled by that point during one rotation of
the Earth about its axis, i.e., over one day, expressed in
terms of $\theta$ and $R$, the radius of the earth.
Check: Your equation should give $L=0$ for the North Pole.\hwendpart
(b) At what speed is Fullerton, at latitude 
$\theta=34\degunit$, moving with the rotation of the Earth about its
axis?  Give your answer in units of mi/h. [See the table in
the back of the book for the relevant data.]\answercheck
