(a) Prove the identity $\vc{a}\times(\vc{b}\times\vc{c})=\vc{b}(\vc{a}\cdot\vc{c})-\vc{c}(\vc{a}\cdot\vc{b})$
by expanding the product in terms of its components.
Note that because the $x$, $y$, and $z$ components are treated symmetrically in the definitions 
of the vector cross product, it is only necessary to carry out the proof for the $x$ component of
the result.\\
(b) Applying this to the angular momentum of a rigidly rotating body, $L=\int \vc{r}\times(\bomega\times\vc{r})\der m$,
show that the diagonal elements of the moment of inertia tensor can be expressed as, e.g.,
$I_{xx}=\int (y^2+z^2)\der m$.\\
(c) Find the diagonal elements of the moment of inertia matrix of an ellipsoid with
axes of lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$, in the principal-axis frame,
and with the axis at the center.\answercheck
