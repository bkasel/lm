The figure shows a ball on the end of a string of length
$L$ attached to a vertical rod which is spun about its
vertical axis by a motor. The period (time for one rotation) is $P$.\hwendpart
 %
(a) Analyze the forces in which the ball participates.\hwendpart
 %
(b) Find how the angle $\theta $ depends on $P,g$, and $L$.
[Hints: (1) Write down Newton's second law for the vertical
and horizontal components of force and acceleration. This
gives two equations, which can be solved for the two
unknowns, $\theta $ and the tension in the string. (2) If
you introduce variables like $v$ and $r$, relate them to the
variables your solution is supposed to contain, and eliminate them.]\answercheck\hwendpart

(c) What happens mathematically to your solution if the
motor is run very slowly (very large values of $P$)?
Physically, what do you think would actually happen in this case?
