Cosmic rays are particles from outer space, mostly
protons and atomic nuclei, that are continually bombarding
the earth. Most of them, although they are moving extremely
fast, have no discernible effect even if they hit your body,
because their masses are so small. Their energies vary,
however, and a very small minority of them have extremely
large energies. In some cases the energy is as much as
several Joules, which is comparable to the KE of a well
thrown rock! If you are in a plane at a high altitude and
are so incredibly unlucky as to be hit by one of these rare
ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, what would you notice, the
momentum imparted to your body, the energy dissipated in
your body as heat, or both? Base your conclusions on
numerical estimates, not just random speculation. (At these
high speeds, one should really take into account the
deviations from Newtonian physics described by Einstein's
special theory of relativity. Don't worry about that, though.)
