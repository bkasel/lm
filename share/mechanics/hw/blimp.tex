A blimp is initially at rest, hovering, when at $t=0$ the
        pilot turns on the engine driving the propeller. The engine cannot
        instantly get the propeller going, but the propeller speeds
        up steadily. The steadily increasing force between the air
        and the propeller is given by the equation $F=kt$, where $k$ is
        a constant. If the mass of the blimp is $m$, find its position
        as a function of time. (Assume that during the period of
        time you're dealing with, the blimp is not yet moving fast
        enough to cause a significant backward force due to air
        resistance.)\answercheck
