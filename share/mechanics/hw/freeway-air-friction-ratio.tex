While in your car on the freeway, you're travelling at a constant
speed of 55 miles/hour, requiring a power output of 50
horsepower from the engine. Almost all of the energy provided by the
engine is used to fight air resistance, which is
proportional in magnitude to the square of the speed of the car. If
you step on the gas pedal all the way and increase the power output
to 100 horsepower, what final speed will you reach? Note that this
problem can be done without any conversions or knowledge of US units.\answercheck
