<% hw_solution %>  An engineer is designing a curved off-ramp for a
freeway. Since the off-ramp is curved, she wants to bank it
to make it less likely that motorists going too fast will
wipe out. If the radius of the curve is $r$, how great
should the banking angle, $\theta $, be so that for a car
going at a speed $v$, no static friction force whatsoever is
required to allow the car to make the curve? State your
answer in terms of $v$, $r$, and $g$, and show that the mass of
the car is irrelevant.
