A bird is initially flying horizontally east at 21.1
        m/s, but one second later it has changed direction so that
        it is flying horizontally and $7\degunit$ north of east, at the same
        speed. What are the magnitude and direction of its
        acceleration vector during that one second time interval?
        (Assume its acceleration was roughly constant.) \answercheck
