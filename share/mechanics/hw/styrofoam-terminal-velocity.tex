A small piece of styrofoam packing material is dropped from rest at a
height $2.00\ \munit$ above the ground at time $t=0$.
The magnitude of its acceleration is given by $a = g - bv$, where $v$
is the speed of the styrofoam, $g = 9.8\ \munit/\sunit^2$, and $b$
is a positive constant. After falling $0.500\ \munit$,
the styrofoam effectively reaches terminal speed and then takes 
$5.00\ \sunit$ more to reach the ground.\\
