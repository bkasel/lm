The figure shows two different ways of combining a
pair of identical springs, each with spring constant $k$. We
refer to the top setup as parallel, and the bottom one as a
series arrangement.\hwendpart
 %
 (a) For the parallel arrangement,
analyze the forces acting on the connector piece on the
left, and then use this analysis to determine the equivalent
spring constant of the whole setup. Explain whether the
combined spring constant should be interpreted as being
stiffer or less stiff.\hwendpart
 %
 (b) For the series arrangement,
analyze the forces acting on each spring and figure
out the same things.<% hw_solution %>
