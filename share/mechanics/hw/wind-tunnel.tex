The diagram shows a cross-section of a wind tunnel of the kind used, for example,
        to test designs of airplanes. Under normal conditions of use, the density of the air
        remains nearly constant throughout the whole wind tunnel. How can the speed of
        the air be controlled and calculated? (Diagram by NASA, Glenn Research Center.)
