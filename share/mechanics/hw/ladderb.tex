Continuing problem \ref{hw:laddera}, find an equation for $\phi$
in terms of $\theta$, and show that $m$ and $L$ do not enter into the
equation. Do not assume any numerical values for any of the
variables. You will need the trig identity $\sin(a-b) = \sin a
\cos b - \sin b \cos a$. (As a numerical check on your result,
you may wish to check that the angles given in problem \ref{hw:laddera}b
satisfy your equation.)\answercheck
