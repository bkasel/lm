You wish to determine the mass of a ship in a bottle
without taking it out. Show that this can be done with the
setup shown in the figure, with a scale supporting the
bottle at one end, provided that it is possible to take
readings with the ship slid to several different locations.
Note that you can't determine the position of the ship's center of mass
just by looking at it, and likewise for the bottle.
In particular, you can't just say, 
``position the ship right on top of the fulcrum'' or
``position it right on top of the balance.''
