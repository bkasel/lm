(a) Determine the ratio between the escape velocities
from the surfaces of the earth and the moon.  \answercheck\hwendpart
(b) The
temperature during the lunar daytime gets up to about 130\degcunit.
In the extremely thin (almost nonexistent) lunar atmosphere,
estimate how the typical velocity of a molecule would
compare with that of the same type of molecule in the
earth's atmosphere. Assume that the earth's atmosphere has
a temperature of 0\degcunit.  \answercheck\hwendpart
(c) Suppose you were to go to the moon
and release some fluorocarbon gas, with molecular formula
$\zu{C}_n\zu{F}_{2n+2}$. Estimate what is the smallest fluorocarbon molecule
(lowest $n$) whose typical velocity would be lower than that
of an $\zu{N}_2$ molecule on earth in proportion to the moon's lower
escape velocity. The moon would be able to retain an atmosphere made
of these molecules. \answercheck
