A person of mass $M$ stands in the middle of a tightrope,
which is fixed at the ends to two buildings separated by a
horizontal distance $L$. The rope sags in the middle,
stretching and lengthening the rope slightly.\hwendpart

 (a) If the
tightrope walker wants the rope to sag vertically by no more
than a height $h$, find the minimum tension, $T$, that the
rope must be able to withstand without breaking, in terms of
$h$, $g$, $M$, and $L$.\answercheck\hwendpart

(b) Based on your equation, explain why it
is not possible to get $h=0$, and give a physical interpretation.
