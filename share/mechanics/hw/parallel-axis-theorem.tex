Suppose an object has mass $m$, and moment of inertia $I_\zu{o}$ for rotation about some axis A
passing through its center of mass. Prove that for an axis B, parallel to A and lying at a distance $h$ from
it, the object's moment of inertia is given by $I_\zu{o}+mh^2$. This is known as the parallel axis theorem.\index{parallel axis theorem}
