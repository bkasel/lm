A projectile is moving directly away from a planet of mass $M$ at exactly
        escape velocity. (a) Find $r$, the distance from the projectile to the center
        of the planet, as a function of time, $t$, and also find $v(t)$.\answercheck\hwendpart
        (b) Check the units of your answer.\hwendpart
        (c) Does $v$ show the correct behavior as $t$ approaches infinity?
