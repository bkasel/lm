(a) In a race, you run the first half of the distance at speed $u$,
and the second half at speed $v$. Find the over-all speed, i.e.,
the total distance divided by the total time.\answercheck\hwendpart

(b) Check the units of your equation %

using the method shown in example \ref{eg:checking-units} on p.~\pageref{eg:checking-units}.:])

(c) Check that your answer makes sense in the case where $u=v$.\hwendpart

(d) Show that the dependence of your result on $u$ and $v$ makes sense. That is, first
check whether making $u$ bigger makes the result bigger, or smaller. Then compare this
with what you expect physically.__shotwell
