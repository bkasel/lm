A uniform ladder of mass $m$ and length $L$ leans against
a smooth wall, making an angle $\theta$ with respect to the
ground. The dirt exerts a normal force and a frictional
force on the ladder, producing a force vector with magnitude
$F_1$ at an angle $\phi $ with respect to the ground. Since
the wall is smooth, it exerts only a normal force on the
ladder; let its magnitude be $F_2$.\\
(a) Explain why $\phi $ must be greater than $\theta$.
No math is needed.\hwendpart
(b) Choose any numerical values you like for $m$ and $L$,
and show that the ladder can be in equilibrium (zero torque
and zero total force vector) for $\theta=45.00\degunit$
and $\phi=63.43\degunit$.
