Ginny has a plan. She is going to ride her sled while
her dog Foo pulls her, and she holds on to his leash.
However, Ginny hasn't taken physics,
so there may be a problem: she may slide right off the sled
when Foo starts pulling.\hwendpart

 (a) Analyze all the forces in which
Ginny participates, making a table as in 
m4_ifelse(__problems,1,[:section \ref{sec:newton-2-analysis-of-forces}:],[:__subsection_or_section(analysis-of-forces):]).\hwendpart

 (b) Analyze all the forces in which the sled participates.\hwendpart
 %
 (c) The sled has mass $m$, and Ginny has mass $M$. The
coefficient of static friction between the sled and the snow
is $\mu_1$, and $\mu_2$ is the corresponding quantity for
static friction between the sled and her snow pants. Ginny
must have a certain minimum mass so that she will not slip
off the sled. Find this in terms of the other three
variables.\answercheck\hwendpart

(d) Interpreting your equation from part c, 
under what conditions will there be no physically realistic solution for $M$? Discuss
what this means physically.
