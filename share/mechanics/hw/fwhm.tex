The goal of this problem is to refine the proportionality
$\text{FWHM} \propto f_{res}/Q$ into the equation $\text{FWHM}=f_{res}/Q$, i.e.,
to prove that the constant of proportionality equals 1.

(a) Show that the work done by a damping force $F=-bv$
over one cycle of steady-state motion equals $W_{damp}=-2\pi ^2bfA^2$.
 Hint: It is less confusing to calculate the
work done over half a cycle, from $x=-A$ to $x=+A$, and then double it.

(b) Show that the fraction of the undriven oscillator's
energy lost to damping over one cycle is 
$|W_{damp}|/ E=4\pi ^2bf/k$.

(c) Use the previous result, combined with the result of
problem 4, to prove that $Q$ equals $k/2\pi bf$ .

(d) Combine the preceding result for $Q$ with the equation
$\text{FWHM}=b/2\pi m$ from section \ref{sec:resonance-proofs} to prove the equation $\text{FWHM}=f_{res}/Q$.
