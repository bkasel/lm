(a) As suggested in the figure, find the area of the infinitesimal region
expressed in polar coordinates as lying between $r$ and $r+\der r$ and
between $\theta$ and $\theta+\der\theta$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Generalize this to find the infinitesimal element of volume in cylindrical coordinates $(r,\theta,z)$, where the
Cartesian $z$ axis is perpendicular to the directions measured by $r$ and $\theta$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(c) Find the moment of inertia for rotation about its axis
of a cone whose mass is $M$, whose height is $h$, and whose base
has a radius $b$.\answercheck
