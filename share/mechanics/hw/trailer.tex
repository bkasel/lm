At low speeds, every car's acceleration is limited by traction, not by the
        engine's power.
        Suppose that at low speeds, a certain car is normally capable of an acceleration of $3\ \munit/\sunit^2$. 
        If it is towing a trailer with half as much mass as the car
        itself, what acceleration can it achieve? [Based on a
        problem from PSSC Physics.]
