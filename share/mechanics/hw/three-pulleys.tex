In the system shown in the figure, the pulleys on the
left and right are fixed, but the pulley in the center can
move to the left or right. The two masses are identical.
m4_ifelse(__lm_series,1,[:%
Show that the mass on the left will have an upward
acceleration equal to $g/5$.
:],[:%
Find the upward acceleration of the mass on the left, in terms of $g$
only.
%-------- Mechanics version, differs from SN version because no hint

%         (intended to be done with N's laws, which is easier).
:]) Assume all the ropes and
pulleys are massless and frictionless.

Hints: (1) Use rules 1-3 on p.~\pageref{pulley-rules}.
(2) The approach is similar to the one in problem \ref{hw:atwood},
but the ratio of the accelerations isn't 1:1.\answercheck
