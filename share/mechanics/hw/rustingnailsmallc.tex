A typical balance like the ones used in school classes can be read to an accuracy
of about plus or minus $0.1$ grams, or $10^{-4}$ kg. What if the laws of physics had been
designed around a different value of the speed of light? To make mass-energy
equivalence detectable in example \ref{eg:rustingnail} on page \pageref{eg:rustingnail}
using an ordinary balance, would $c$ have to be smaller than it is in our universe,
or bigger? Find the value of $c$ for which the effect would be just barely detectable.\answercheck
