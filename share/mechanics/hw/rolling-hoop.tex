(a) A circular hoop of mass $m$ and radius $r$ spins
like a wheel while its center remains at rest. Its period
(time required for one revolution) is $T$. Show that its
kinetic energy equals $2\pi^2mr^2/T^2$.\hwendpart
 (b) If such a
hoop rolls with its center moving at velocity $v$, its
kinetic energy equals $(1/2)mv^2$, plus the amount
of kinetic energy found in the first part of this problem.
Show that a hoop rolls down an inclined plane with half the
acceleration that a frictionless sliding block would have.
