The ratios of the masses of different types of atoms were determined a century
        before anyone knew any actual atomic masses in units of kg. One finds, for example,
        that when ordinary table salt, NaCl, is melted, the chlorine atoms bubble off as a
        gas, leaving liquid sodium metal. Suppose the chlorine escapes, so that
        its mass cannot be directly determined by weighing. Experiments show that when 1.00000 kg
        of NaCl is treated in this way, the mass of the remaining sodium metal is 0.39337 kg.
        Based on this information, determine the ratio of the mass of a chlorine atom
        to that of a sodium atom.\answercheck
