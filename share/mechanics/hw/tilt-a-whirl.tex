The amusement park ride shown in the figure consists
of a cylindrical room that rotates about its vertical axis.
When the rotation is fast enough, a person against the wall
can pick his or her feet up off the floor and remain
``stuck'' to the wall without falling.\hwendpart

(a) Suppose the rotation results in the person having a
speed $v$. The radius of the cylinder is $r$, the person's
mass is $m$, the downward acceleration of gravity is $g$,
and the coefficient of static friction between the person
and the wall is $\mu_s$.  Find an equation for the speed,
$v$, required, in terms of the other variables.  (You will
find that one of the variables cancels out.)\hwendpart
 %
(b) Now suppose two people are riding the ride.  Huy is
wearing denim, and Gina is wearing polyester, so Huy's
coefficient of static friction is three times greater.  The
ride starts from rest, and as it begins rotating faster and
faster, Gina must wait longer before being able to lift her
feet without sliding to the floor.  Based on your equation
from part a, how many times greater must the speed be before
Gina can lift her feet without sliding down?<% hw_solution %>
