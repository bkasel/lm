 Psychology professor R.O. Dent requests funding for an
experiment on compulsive thrill-seeking behavior in
guinea pigs, in which the subject is to be attached to the end
of a spring and whirled around in a horizontal circle. The
spring has relaxed length $b$, and obeys Hooke's law
with spring constant $k$. It is stiff enough to keep from
bending significantly under the guinea pig's weight.\hwendpart

(a) Calculate the length of the spring when it is
undergoing steady circular motion in which one rotation
takes a time $T$. Express your result in terms of $k$, $b$, $T$, and the
guinea pig's mass $m$.\answercheck\hwendpart

(b) The ethics committee somehow fails to veto the
experiment, but the safety committee expresses concern. Why?
Does your equation do anything unusual, or even spectacular,
for any particular value of $T$?  What do you think is the
physical significance of this mathematical behavior?
