Penguins are playful animals. Tux the Penguin invents a new game using a natural
circular depression in the ice. He waddles at top speed toward the crater,
aiming off to the side, and then hops into the air and lands on his belly just
inside its lip. He then belly-surfs, moving in a circle around the rim. The ice
is frictionless, so his speed is constant.
Is Tux's angular momentum zero, or nonzero? What about the total torque acting
on him? Take the center of the crater to be the axis. Explain your answers.
