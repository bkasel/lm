Assume that dogs' and cats' brains are the same shape, and that their brain cells
        are also the same size and shape,
        but that a dog's brain is twice as large as a cat's in all its linear dimensions, i.e.,
        any two points in a dog's brain are twice as far apart as the corresponding two
        points in a cat's. How many times more brain cells does a dog have compared to a
        cat? The answer is not 2.
