In 1935, Yukawa proposed an early theory of the force
that held the neutrons and protons together in the nucleus.
His equation for the potential energy of two such particles,
at a center-to-center distance $r$, was 
$PE(r)=gr^{-1}e^{-r/a}$,
where $g$ parametrizes the strength
of the interaction, $e$ is the base of natural logarithms,
and $a$ is about $10^{-15}$ m. Find the force between two
nucleons that would be consistent with this equation for
the potential energy.
