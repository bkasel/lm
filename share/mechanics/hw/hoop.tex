(a) A circular hoop of mass $m$ and radius $r$ spins like a
        wheel while its center remains at rest.  Let $\omega$ (Greek letter omega) be 
        the number of radians it covers per unit time, i.e., $\omega=2\pi/T$, 
        where the
        period, $T$, is the time for one revolution.
        Show that its kinetic
        energy equals $(1/2)m\omega^2r^2$. \hwendpart
        (b) Show that the answer to part a
        has the right units. (Note that radians aren't really units, since the definition
        of a radian is a unitless ratio of two lengths.)\hwendpart
        (c) If such a hoop rolls with its
        center moving at velocity $v$, its kinetic energy
        equals $(1/2)mv^2$, plus the amount of kinetic energy found in
        part a. Show that a hoop rolls down
        an inclined plane with half the acceleration that a
        frictionless sliding block would have.
