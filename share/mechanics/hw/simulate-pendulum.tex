An idealized pendulum consists of a pointlike mass $m$ on the end of a massless,
        rigid rod of length $L$. Its amplitude, $\theta$, is the angle the rod makes with the
        vertical when the pendulum is at the end of its swing. Write a numerical simulation
        to determine the period of the pendulum for any combination of $m$, $L$, and
        $\theta$. Examine the effect of changing each variable while manipulating the
        others.
