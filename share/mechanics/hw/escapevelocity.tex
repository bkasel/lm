If a bullet is shot straight up at a high enough
velocity, it will never return to the earth. This is known
as the escape velocity.
m4_ifelse(__problems,1,[:%:],[:We will discuss escape velocity
using the concept of energy later in the course,
but it can also be gotten at using straightforward calculus.:])
In this problem, you will analyze the motion of an object of
mass $m$ whose initial velocity is \emph{exactly} equal to
escape velocity. We assume that it is starting from the
surface of a spherically symmetric planet of mass $M$ and
radius $b$. The trick is to guess at the general form of the
solution, and then determine the solution in more detail.
Assume (as is true) that the solution is of the form 
$r= kt^p$, where $r$ is the object's distance from the center of
the planet at time $t$, and $k$ and $p$ are constants.\hwendpart

 (a)
Find the acceleration, and use Newton's second law and
Newton's law of gravity to determine $k$ and $p$. You should
find that the result is independent of $m$.\answercheck\hwendpart

to the velocity as $t$ approaches infinity?\hwendpart

 (c) Determine
escape velocity from the Earth's surface.\answercheck
