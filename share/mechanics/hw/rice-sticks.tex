 When I cook rice, some of the dry grains always stick to the
measuring cup. To get them out, I turn the measuring cup upside-down and hit the
``roof'' with my hand so that the grains come off of the ``ceiling.''
(a) Explain why static friction is irrelevant here.
(b) Explain why gravity is negligible.
(c) Explain why hitting the cup works, and why its success depends on
hitting the cup hard enough.
