Most of the atoms in the universe are in the form of gas that is not
part of any star or galaxy: the intergalactic medium (IGM). The IGM
consists of about $10^{-5}$ atoms per cubic
centimeter, with a typical temperature of about $10^3$ K.
These are, in some sense, the density and temperature of
the universe (not counting light, or the exotic particles known
as ``dark matter''). Calculate the pressure of the universe
(or, speaking more carefully, the typical pressure due to
the IGM).\answercheck
