Figure \figref{film-dropping} on page \pageref{fig:film-dropping}
shows a ball dropping to the surface of the earth. Energy is conserved: over the
whole course of the film, the gravitational energy between the ball and the earth decreases
by 1 joule, while the ball's kinetic energy increases by 1 joule.\hwendpart
(a) How can you tell \emph{directly from the figure}
 that the ball's speed isn't staying the same?\hwendpart
(b) Draw what the film would look like if the camera was following the ball.\hwendpart
(c) Explain how you can tell that in this new frame of reference, energy is not conserved.\hwendpart
(d) Does this violate the strong principle of inertia? Isn't every frame of reference supposed to be equally valid?
