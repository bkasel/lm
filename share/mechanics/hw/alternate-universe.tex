Suppose that we lived in a universe in which Newton's
law of gravity gave m4_ifelse(__sn,1,[:an interaction energy proportional to $r^{-6}$, rather than $r^{-1}$.:],[:forces proportional to $r^{-7}$ rather than $r^{-2}$.:])
Which, if any, of Kepler's laws would still be true?
Which would be completely false? Which would be different,
but in a way that could be calculated with straightforward
algebra?
