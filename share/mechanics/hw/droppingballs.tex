 The figure shows a practical, simple experiment for
determining $g$ to high precision. Two steel balls are
suspended from electromagnets, and are released simultaneously
when the electric current is shut off. They fall through
unequal heights $\Delta x_1$ and $\Delta x_2$. A computer
records the sounds through a microphone as first one ball
and then the other strikes the floor. From this recording,
we can accurately determine the quantity $T$ defined as
$T=\Delta t_2-\Delta t_1$, i.e., the time lag between the
first and second impacts.  Note that since the balls do not
make any sound when they are released, we have no way of
measuring the individual times $\Delta t_2$ and $\Delta t_1$.\hwendpart

the correct result in the case where $\Delta x_1$ is very
close to zero. However, is this case realistic?\hwendpart

(d) What
happens when $\Delta x_1=\Delta x_2$? Discuss this both
mathematically and physically.
