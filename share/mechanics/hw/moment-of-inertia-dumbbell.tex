A dumbbell consists of two solid, spherical masses (each of mass $M$)
attached to the two ends of a bar, also of mass $M$. The length of
the bar is $L$.\\
%
(a) Find the moment of inertia of the mass distribution about an axis
through the center of mass and perpendicular to the bar, assuming the balls
are pointlike.\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(b) Now find the moment of inertia assuming the spherical
masses have radius $r$. You will need to use the parallel-axis
theorem for this. To simplify the math and make it easier to compare the answers
to parts a and b, take the densities to add in the places where the bar's volume overlaps
with the volume of a ball.\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(c) Let $r=L/5$. By what percentage is your result from part a off from that in
part b? Give your answer to two significant
figures.\answercheck
