As suggested on page \pageref{text:changing-electron-mass}, imagine that the mass of
the electron rises and falls over time. (Since all electrons are identical, physicists
generally talk about ``the electron'' collectively, as in ``the modern man wants more
than just beer and sports.'') The idea is that all electrons are increasing and
decreasing their masses in unison, and at any given time, they're all identical. They're
like a litter of puppies whose weights are all identical on any given day, but who all
change their weights in unison from one month to the next.
Suppose you were the only person who knew about these small day-to-day changes in the
mass of the electron. Find a plan for violating conservation of energy and getting
rich.
