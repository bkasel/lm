A battleship has a gun that fires shells with muzzle velocity $u$,
and the gunner wants to hit an enemy ship at range $L$. The gun is
to be fired at some angle $\theta$ above the horizontal. Find the
two possible values of $\theta$ that are possible under normal conditions. Under what conditions are there
one solution or no solutions at all? To what extent is the form of
the solution determined by units?
