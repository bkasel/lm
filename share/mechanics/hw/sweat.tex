Explain in
terms of conservation of energy why sweating cools your
body, even though the sweat is at the same temperature as
your body. Describe the forms of energy involved in this
energy transformation.
Why don't you get the same cooling effect if you
wipe the sweat off with a towel? Hint: 
The sweat is evaporating.
