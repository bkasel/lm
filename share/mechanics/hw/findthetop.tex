(a) Continue figure \figref{parabolaball} farther to the left, and do the
same for the numerical table in the text.\hwendpart
(b) Sketch a smooth curve (a parabola) through all the points on the figure, including all
the ones from the original figure and all the ones you added. Identify the very top of
its arc.\hwendpart
(c) Now consider figure \figref{dropball}. Is the highest point shown in the figure the
top of the ball's up-down path? Explain by comparing with your results from parts a and b.
