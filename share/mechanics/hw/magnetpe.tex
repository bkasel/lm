The magnitude of the force between two magnets
separated by a distance $r$ can be approximated as $kr^{-3}$ for
large values of $r$. The constant $k$ depends on the
strengths of the magnets and the relative orientations of
their north and south poles. Two magnets are released on a
slippery surface at an initial distance $r_i$, and begin
sliding towards each other. What will be the total kinetic
energy of the two magnets when they reach a final distance
$r_f?$ (Ignore friction.)
