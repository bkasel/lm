A ball is connected by a string to a vertical post. The
ball is set in horizontal motion so that it starts winding
the string around the post. Assume that the motion is
confined to a horizontal plane, i.e., ignore gravity.
Michelle and Astrid are trying to predict the final velocity
of the ball when it reaches the post. Michelle says that
according to conservation of angular momentum, the ball has
to speed up as it approaches the post. Astrid says that
according to conservation of energy, the ball has to keep a
constant speed. Who is right? [Hint: How is this different
from the case where you whirl a rock in a circle on a string
and gradually reel in the string?]
