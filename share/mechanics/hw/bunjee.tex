Draw graphs of position, velocity, and acceleration as
functions of time for a person bunjee jumping. (In bunjee
jumping, a person has a stretchy elastic cord tied to
his/her ankles, and jumps off of a high platform. At the
bottom of the fall, the cord brings the person up short.
Presumably the person bounces up a little.)
Do your work on a photocopy or a printout of
