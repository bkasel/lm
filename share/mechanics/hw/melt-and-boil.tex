The following table gives the amount of energy required in order to
        heat, melt, or boil a gram of water.\\
        \begin{tabular}{ll}
        heat 1 g of ice by $1\degcunit$        & 2.05 J\\
        melt 1 g of ice                        & 333 J\\
        heat 1 g of water by $1\degcunit$ &         4.19 J\\
        boil 1 g of water                & 2500 J\\
        heat 1 g of steam by $1\degcunit$        & 2.01 J\\
        \end{tabular}\\
        (a) How much energy is required in order to convert 1.00 g of
        ice at -20 $\degcunit$ into steam at 137 $\degcunit$? \answercheck\hwendpart
        (b) What is the minimum amount of hot water that could melt 1.00 g
        of ice? \answercheck
