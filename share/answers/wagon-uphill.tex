(a) Since the wagon has no acceleration, the total
forces in both the x and y directions must be zero.
There are three forces acting on the wagon: $\vc{F}_T$, $\vc{F}_W$,
and the normal force from the ground, $\vc{F}_N$. If we pick a
coordinate system with x being horizontal and y
vertical, then the angles of these forces measured
counterclockwise from the x axis are $90\degunit-\phi$,
$270\degunit$, and $90\degunit+\theta$, respectively. We have
\begin{align*}
    F_{x,total}
             & =   |\vc{F}_T|\cos (90\degunit-\phi ) 
                 + |\vc{F}_W|\cos (270\degunit)
                 + |\vc{F}_N|\cos (90\degunit+\theta )\\
    F_{y,total}
             & =  |\vc{F}_T|\sin (90\degunit-\phi )
                + |\vc{F}_W|\sin (270\degunit)
                + |\vc{F}_N|\sin (90\degunit+\theta )\eqquad,
\end{align*}
which simplifies to
\begin{align*}
        0  &=  |\vc{F}_T|\sin  \phi  - |\vc{F}_N|\sin  \theta   \\
        0  &=  |\vc{F}_T|\cos  \phi   - |\vc{F}_W| + |\vc{F}_N|\cos  \theta   .
\end{align*}
The normal force is a quantity that we are not given and do
not wish to find, so we should choose it to eliminate.
Solving the first equation for $|\vc{F}_N|=(\sin  \phi/\sin  \theta)|\vc{F}_T|$,
 we eliminate $|\vc{F}_N|$ from the second equation,
\begin{equation*}
        0  =   |\vc{F}_T|\cos  \phi   
             - |\vc{F}_W| + |\vc{F}_T|\sin  \phi \cos  \theta/\sin  \theta
\end{equation*}
and solve for $|\vc{F}_T|$, finding
\begin{equation*}
    |\vc{F}_T| = \frac{|\vc{F}_W|}{\cos\phi+\sin\phi\cos\theta/\sin\theta}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Multiplying both the top and the bottom of the fraction by
$\sin  \theta $, and using the trig identity for 
$\sin(\theta +\phi )$ gives the desired result,
\begin{equation*}
    |\vc{F}_T| = \frac{\sin\theta}{\sin(\theta+\phi)} |\vc{F}_W|\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
(b) The case of $\phi=0$, i.e., pulling straight up on the
wagon, results in $|\vc{F}_T|=|\vc{F}_W|$: we simply support the wagon and
it glides up the slope like a chair-lift on a ski slope. In
the case of $\phi =180\degunit-\theta$, $|\vc{F}_T|$ becomes infinite.
Physically this is because we are pulling directly into the
ground, so no amount of force will suffice.
