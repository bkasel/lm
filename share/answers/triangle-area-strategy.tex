The method using the cross product is by far the easier way.
The area is simply $(1/2)|\vc{u}\times\vc{v}|$. This just
requires taking one vector cross product and then computing its
magnitude.

To do this using only vector dot products, you would first
have to find the angle between the two vectors from
$\vc{u}\cdot\vc{v}=|\vc{u}||\vc{v}|\cos\theta$. Then you
would find the area as $(1/2)|\vc{u}||\vc{v}|\sin\theta$.
This requires far more computation.
