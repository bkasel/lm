The actual shape is irrelevant; all we care about is
what's connected to what. Therefore, we can draw the circuit
flattened into a plane. Every vertex of the tetrahedron is
adjacent to every other vertex, so any two vertices to which
we connect will give the same resistance. Picking two
arbitrarily, we have this:

\anonymousinlinefig{soln-tetrahedron}

This is unfortunately a circuit that cannot be converted
into parallel and series parts, and that's what makes this a
hard problem! However, we can recognize that by symmetry,
there is zero current in the resistor marked with an
asterisk. Eliminating this one, we recognize the whole
arrangement as a triple parallel circuit consisting of
resistances $R$, $2R$, and $2R$. The resulting resistance is $R/2$.
