The two-dimensional idea is actually unimportant, so the
sum can be simplified to
\begin{equation*}
  \sum_{m=0}^{63} 2^m.
\end{equation*}
In binary, this is $11111111\ldots11111111$, a string of
64 ones, which is the same as $2^{64}-1$, or approximately
$(2^{10})^6\cdot 2^4\approx (1000)^6\cdot 16=1.6\times10^{19}$,
which is certainly more grains of wheat than have ever existed
in the world.
