Note that in the Biot-Savart law, the variable $\vc{r}$ is defined as a vector
that points from the current to the point at which the field is being calculated,
whereas in the polar coordinates used to express the equation of the spiral, the
vector more naturally points the opposite way. This requires some fiddling with
signs, which I'll suppress, and simply identify $\der\bell$ with $\der\vc{r}$.
\begin{align*}
  \vc{B} &= \frac{kI}{c^2}\int \frac{\der\bell\times\vc{r}}{r^3}
\end{align*}
The vector $\der\vc{r}$ has components $\der x=w(\cos\theta-\theta\sin\theta)$ and
$\der y=w(\sin\theta+\theta\cos\theta)$. Evaluating the vector cross product, and
substituting $\theta/w$ for $r$, we find
\begin{align*}
  \vc{B} &= \frac{kI}{c^2w}\int \frac{\theta(\cos\theta\sin\theta-\theta\sin^2\theta-\cos\theta\sin\theta-\theta\cos^2\theta)\der\theta}{\theta^3} \\
         &= \frac{kI}{c^2w}\int \frac{\der\theta}{\theta} \\
         &= \frac{kI}{c^2w}\ln\frac{\theta_2}{\theta_1} \\   
         &= \frac{kI}{c^2w}\ln\frac{b}{a}
\end{align*}
