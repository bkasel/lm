The heating element of an electric stove is connected in
series with a switch that opens and closes many times per
second. When you turn the knob up for more power, the
fraction of the time that the switch is closed increases.
Suppose someone suggests a simpler alternative for
controlling the power by putting the heating element in
series with a variable resistor controlled by the knob.
(With the knob turned all the way clockwise, the variable
resistor's resistance is nearly zero, and when it's all the
way counterclockwise, its resistance is essentially
infinite.) (a) Draw schematics. (b) Why would the simpler
design be undesirable?
