A student in a biology lab is given the following
        instructions: ``Connect the cerebral eraser (C.E.) and the
        neural depolarizer (N.D.) in parallel with the power supply
        (P.S.).  (Under no circumstances should you ever allow the
        cerebral eraser to come within 20 cm of your head.)  Connect
        a voltmeter to measure the voltage across the cerebral
        eraser, and also insert an ammeter in the circuit so that
        you can make sure you don't put more than 100 mA through the
        neural depolarizer.''  The diagrams show two lab groups'
        attempts to follow the instructions.  \hwendpart
        (a) Translate diagram
        1 into a standard-style schematic. What is correct and
        incorrect about this group's setup?  \hwendpart
        (b) Do the same for diagram 2.
