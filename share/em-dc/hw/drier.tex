(a) Express the power dissipated by a resistor in terms
        of $R$ and $\Delta V$ only, eliminating $I$.

        (b)
        Electrical receptacles in your home are mostly 110 V, but
        circuits for electric stoves, air conditioners, and washers
        and driers are usually 220 V.  The two types of circuits
        have differently shaped receptacles.  Suppose you rewire the
        plug of a drier so that it can be plugged in to a 110 V
        receptacle.  The resistor that forms the heating element of
        the drier would normally draw 200 W.  How much power does
        it actually draw now?
