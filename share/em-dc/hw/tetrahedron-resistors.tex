Suppose six identical resistors, each with resistance
$R$, are connected so that they form the edges of a
tetrahedron (a pyramid with three sides in addition to the
base, i.e., one less side than an Egyptian pyramid). What
resistance value or values can be obtained by making
connections onto any two points on this arrangement?<% hw_solution %>
