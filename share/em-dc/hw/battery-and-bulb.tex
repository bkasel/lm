You are given a battery, a flashlight bulb, and a single
        piece of wire.  Draw at least two configurations of these
        items that would result in lighting up the bulb, and at
        least two that would not light it.  (Don't draw schematics.)
         If you're not sure what's going on, borrow the materials
        from your instructor and try it. Note that the bulb has two
        electrical contacts: one is the threaded metal jacket, and
        the other is the tip (at the bottom in the figure). [Problem by Arnold Arons.]
