We have referred to resistors \emph{dissipating} heat,
        i.e., we have assumed that $P=I\Delta V$ is always greater
        than zero.  Could $I\Delta V$ come out to be negative for
        a resistor?  If so, could one make a refrigerator by hooking
        up a resistor in such a way that it absorbed heat instead of dissipating it?
