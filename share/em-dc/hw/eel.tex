(a) Many battery-operated devices take more than one
        battery. If you look closely in the battery compartment, you
        will see that the batteries are wired in series. Consider a
        flashlight circuit. What does the loop rule tell you about
        the effect of putting several batteries in series in this
        way? \hwendpart
        (b) The cells of an electric eel's nervous system are
        not that different from ours --- each cell can develop a
        voltage difference across it of somewhere on the order of
        one volt. How, then, do you think an electric eel can create
        voltages of thousands of volts between different parts of its body?
