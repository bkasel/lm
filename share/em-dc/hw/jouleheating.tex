A resistor has a voltage difference $\Delta V$ across it,
        causing a current $I$ to flow. \hwendpart
        (a) Find an equation for the
        power it dissipates as heat in terms of the variables $I$
        and $R$ only, eliminating $\Delta V$.

        (b) If an electrical
        line coming to your house is to carry a given amount of
        current, interpret your equation from part a to explain
        whether the wire's resistance should be small, or large.
