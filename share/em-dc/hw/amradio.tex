In AM (amplitude-modulated) radio, an audio signal
        $f(t)$ is multiplied by a sine wave $\sin \omega t$
        in the megahertz frequency range. For simplicity, let's
        imagine that the transmitting antenna is a whip, and that
        charge goes back and forth between the top and bottom.
        Suppose that, during a certain time interval,
        the audio signal varies linearly with time, giving
        a charge $q=(a+bt)\sin \omega t$ at the top of the whip and $-q$ at
        the bottom. Find the current as a function of time.
