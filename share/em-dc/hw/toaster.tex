A 1.0 $\Omega$ toaster and a 2.0 $\Omega$ lamp are connected in
        parallel with the 110-V supply of your house. (Ignore the
        fact that the voltage is AC rather than DC.) \hwendpart
        (a) Draw a
        schematic of the circuit.  \hwendpart
        (b)  For each of the three
        components in the circuit, find the current passing through
        it and the voltage drop across it. \answercheck\hwendpart
        (c) Suppose they were
        instead hooked up in series.  Draw a schematic and
        calculate the same things.\answercheck
