(a) You take an LP record out of its sleeve, and it
        acquires a static charge of 1 nC.  You play it at the normal
        speed of $33\frac{1}{3}$ r.p.m., and the charge moving in a circle
        creates an electric current.  What is the current, in amperes?

        (b) Although the planetary model of the atom can be made to
        work with any value for the radius of the electrons' orbits,
        more advanced models that we will study later in this course
        predict definite radii. If the electron is imagined as
        circling around the proton at a speed of $2.2\times10^6$ 
        m/s, in an orbit with a radius of 0.05 nm, what electric current is created?
