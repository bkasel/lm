You have a circuit consisting of two unknown resistors in
        series, and a second circuit consisting of two unknown
        resistors in parallel.  \hwendpart
        (a) What, if anything, would you
        learn about the resistors in the series circuit by finding
        that the currents through them were equal? \hwendpart 
        (b) What if you
        found out the voltage differences across the resistors in
        the series circuit were equal?  \hwendpart
        (c) What would you learn
        about the resistors in the parallel circuit from knowing
        that the currents were equal?  \hwendpart
        (d) What if the voltages in
        the parallel circuit were equal?
