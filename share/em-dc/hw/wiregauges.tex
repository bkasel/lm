Wire is sold in a series of standard diameters, called
        ``gauges.'' The difference in diameter between one gauge and
        the next in the series is about 20\%. How would the
        resistance of a given length of wire 
        compare with the resistance of the same length of wire in
        the next gauge in the series?
