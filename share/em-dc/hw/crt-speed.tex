<% hw_solution %> The figure shows a simplified diagram of an electron
gun such as the one used in an old-fashioned TV tube. Electrons
that spontaneously emerge from the negative electrode
(cathode) are then accelerated to the positive electrode,
which has a hole in it. (Once they emerge through the hole,
they will slow down. However, if the two electrodes are
fairly close together, this slowing down is a small effect,
because the attractive and repulsive forces experienced by
the electron tend to cancel.) (a) If the voltage difference
between the electrodes is $\Delta $V, what is the velocity
of an electron as it emerges at B? (Assume its initial
velocity, at A, is negiligible.) (b) Evaluate your
expression numerically for the case where $\Delta V=10\ \zu{kV}$,
and compare to the speed of light.
