Referring back to our old friend the neuron from problem \ref{hw:neuron-stick} on page \pageref{hw:neuron-stick},
        let's now consider what
        happens when the nerve is stimulated to transmit information.
         When the blob at the top (the cell body) is stimulated, it
        causes Na$^+$ ions to rush into the top of the tail (axon). 
        This electrical pulse will then travel down the axon, like a
        flame burning down from the end of a fuse, with the Na$^+$ ions
        at each point first going out and then coming back in.  If
        $10^{10}$  Na$^+$ ions cross the cell membrane in 0.5 ms, what
        amount of current is created?

charge of a Na$^+$ ion is $+e=1.60\times10^{-19}\ \zu{C}$.:])
