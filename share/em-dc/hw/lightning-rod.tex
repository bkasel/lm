In example \ref{eg:lightning-rod} on p.~\pageref{eg:lightning-rod}, suppose that the
larger sphere has radius $a$, the smaller one $b$. (a) Use the result of problem
\ref{hw:pointchargevoltage} to show that the ratio of the charges on the two spheres
is $q_a/q_b=a/b$. (b) Show that the density of charge (charge per unit area)
is the other way around: the charge density on the smaller sphere is \emph{greater}
than that on the larger sphere in the ratio $a/b$.
