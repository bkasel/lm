Three charges, each of strength $Q$ ($Q>0$) form a fixed
equilateral triangle with sides of length $b$. You throw a
particle of mass $m$ and positive charge $q$ from far away,
with an initial speed $v$. Your goal is to get the particle
to go to the center of the triangle, your aim is perfect,
and you are free to throw from any direction you like. What
is the minimum possible value of $v?$
You will need the result of problem \ref{hw:pe-of-point-charges}.
