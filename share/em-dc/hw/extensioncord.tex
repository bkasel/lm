A person in a rural area who has no electricity runs
        an extremely long extension cord to a friend's house down
        the road so she can run an electric light. The cord is so
        long that its resistance, $x$, is not negligible. Show that
        the lamp's brightness is greatest if its resistance, $y$, is
        equal to $x$. Explain physically why the lamp is dim for
        values of $y$ that are too small or too large.
