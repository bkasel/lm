In the figure, the battery is 9 V.  \hwendpart
        (a) What are the
        voltage differences across each light bulb?\answercheck  \hwendpart
        (b) What
        current flows through each of the three components of the
        circuit?  \answercheck\hwendpart
        (c) If a new wire is added to connect points A and
        B, how will the appearances of the bulbs change?  What
        will be the new voltages and currents?  \hwendpart
        (d) Suppose no wire
        is connected from A to B, but the two bulbs are switched. 
        How will the results compare with the results from the
        original setup as drawn?
