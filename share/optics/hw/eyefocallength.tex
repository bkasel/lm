The drawing shows the anatomy of the human eye, at
twice life size. Find the radius of curvature of the outer
surface of the cornea by measurements on the figure, and
then derive the focal length of the air-cornea interface,
where almost all the focusing of light occurs. You will need
to use physical reasoning to modify the lensmaker's equation
for the case where there is only a single refracting
surface. Assume that the index of refraction of the cornea
is essentially that of water.
