In section \ref{sec:images-1} we've only done examples of mirrors with
hollowed-out shapes (called concave mirrors). Now draw a ray
diagram for a curved mirror that has a bulging outward shape
(called a convex mirror). (a) How does the image's distance
from the mirror compare with the actual object's distance
from the mirror? From this comparison, determine whether the
magnification is greater than or less than one. (b) Is the
image real, or virtual? Could this mirror ever make the
other type of image?
