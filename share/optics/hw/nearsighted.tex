A nearsighted person is one whose eyes focus light too
strongly, and who is therefore unable to relax the lens
inside her eye sufficiently to form an image on her retina
of an object that is too far away.

(a) Draw a ray diagram showing what happens when the person
tries, with uncorrected vision, to focus at infinity.

(b) What type of lenses do her glasses have? Explain.

(c) Draw a ray diagram showing what happens when she wears
glasses. Locate both the image formed by the glasses
and the final image.

(d) Suppose she sometimes uses contact lenses instead of her
glasses. Does the focal length of her contacts have to be
less than, equal to, or greater than that of her glasses? Explain.
