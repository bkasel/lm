Diamond has an index of refraction of 2.42, and part of
the reason diamonds sparkle is that this encourages a light
ray to undergo many total internal reflections before it
emerges. (a) Calculate the critical angle at which total
internal reflection occurs in diamond. \answercheck
(b) Explain the
interpretation of your result: Is it measured from the
normal, or from the surface? Is it a minimum angle for total
internal reflection, or is it a maximum?
How would the critical angle have been different for a
substance such as glass or plastic, with a lower index of refraction?
