<% hw_solution %> The figure shows four lenses. Lens 1 has two spherical
surfaces. Lens 2 is the same as lens 1 but turned around.
Lens 3 is made by cutting through lens 1 and turning the
bottom around. Lens 4 is made by cutting a central circle
out of lens 1 and recessing it.

(a) A parallel beam of light enters lens 1 from the left,
parallel to its axis. Reasoning based on Snell's law, will
the beam emerging from the lens be bent inward, or outward,
or will it remain parallel to the axis? Explain your
reasoning. As part of your answer, make a huge
drawing of one small part of the lens, and apply Snell's law
at both interfaces. Recall that rays are bent more if they
come to the interface at a larger angle with respect to the normal.

(b) What will happen with lenses 2, 3, and 4? Explain.
Drawings are not necessary.
