A Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver is a device
that lets you figure out where you are by receiving timed radio
signals from satellites. It works by measuring the
travel time for the signals, which is related to the
distance between you and the satellite. By finding the
ranges to several different satellites in this way, it can
pin down your location in three dimensions to within a few
meters. How accurate does the measurement of the time delay
have to be to determine your position to this accuracy?
