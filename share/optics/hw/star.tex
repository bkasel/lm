<% hw_solution %> For star images such as the ones in figure \figref{pleiades-closeup},
estimate the angular width of the diffraction spot due
to diffraction at the mouth of the telescope. Assume a
telescope with a diameter of 10 meters (the largest
currently in existence), and light with a wavelength in the
middle of the visible range. Compare with the actual angular
size of a star of diameter $10^9$ m seen from a distance of
$10^{17}$ m. What does this tell you?
