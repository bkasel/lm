<% hw_solution %> The  figure on the next page shows a curved (parabolic) mirror, with
three parallel light rays coming toward it. One ray is
approaching along the mirror's center line. (a) Continue the light rays until they
are about to undergo their second reflection.  To get good enough accuracy, you'll need to
photocopy the page (or download the book and print the page)
and draw in the normal at each place where a ray is reflected.
What do you notice?
(b) Make up an example of a practical use for this device.
(c) How could you use this mirror with a small lightbulb to
produce a parallel beam of light rays going off to the right?
