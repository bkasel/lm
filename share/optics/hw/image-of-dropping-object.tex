A diverging mirror of focal length $f$ is fixed, and faces down.
An object is dropped from the surface of the mirror, and falls away
from it with acceleration $g$. The goal of the problem is to find
the maximum velocity of the image.\\
(a) Describe the motion of the image verbally, and explain why we should
expect there to be a maximum velocity.\hwendpart
(b) Use arguments based on units to determine the form of the solution,
up to an unknown unitless multiplicative constant.\hwendpart
(c) Complete the solution by determining the unitless constant.
