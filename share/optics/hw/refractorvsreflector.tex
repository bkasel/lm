There are two main types of telescopes, refracting (using
a lens) and reflecting (using a m4_ifelse(__problems,1,[:mirror:],[:mirror as in figure \figref{newtonian-telescope-eye}
on p.~\pageref{fig:newtonian-telescope-eye}:])). (Some telescopes
use a mixture of the two types of elements: the light first
encounters a large curved mirror, and then goes through an
eyepiece that is a lens. To keep things simple, assume no eyepiece is used.) What implications would the
color-dependence of focal length have for the relative
merits of the two types of telescopes? Describe the case
where an image is formed of a white star. You may find
it helpful to draw a ray diagram.
