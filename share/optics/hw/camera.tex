When you take pictures with a camera, the distance
between the lens and the film or chip has to be adjusted, depending
on the distance at which you want to focus. This is done by
moving the lens. If you want to change your focus so that
you can take a picture of something farther away, which way
do you have to move the lens? Explain using ray diagrams.
