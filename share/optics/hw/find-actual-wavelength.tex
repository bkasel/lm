The figure 
m4_ifelse(__sn,1,[:on p.~\pageref{fig:hw-with-ruler}:],[::]) shows a diffraction pattern made by a double
slit, along with an image of a meter stick to show the
scale. The slits were 146 cm away from the screen on which
the diffraction pattern was projected. The spacing of the
slits was 0.050 mm. What was the wavelength of the light?\answercheck
