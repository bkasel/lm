In
m4_ifelse(__problems,1,[:the figure:],[:figure \subfigref{real-and-virtual}{2} in on page \pageref{fig:real-and-virtual}:]), only the image of my
forehead was located by drawing rays. Either photocopy the
figure or download the book and print out the relevant page.
On this copy of the figure, make a new set of rays coming from my chin,
and locate its image. To make it easier to judge the angles
accurately, draw rays from the chin that happen to hit the
mirror at the same points where the two rays from the
forehead were shown hitting it. By comparing the locations
of the chin's image and the forehead's image, verify that
the image is actually upside-down, as shown in the original figure.
