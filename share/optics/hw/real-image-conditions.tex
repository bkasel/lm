Zahra likes to play practical jokes on the friends she goes
hiking with. Late at night, by a blazing camp fire, she stealthily
uses a lens of focal length $f$ to gather light from the fire
and make a hot spot on Becky's neck. (a) 
Using the method of section __bare_subsection_or_section(other-curved-mirrors),
p.~__pageref_subsection_or_section(other-curved-mirrors),
draw a ray diagram and
set up the equation for the
image location, inferring the correct plus and minus signs
from the diagram. (b) Let $A$ be the distance from the lens to
the campfire, and $B$ the distance from the lens to Becky's
neck. Consider the following four possibilities:

\begin{tabular}{llp{8mm}p{8mm}}  
 & & \multicolumn{2}{c}{$B$} \\
                     & &  $<f$ & $>f$ \\           
\multirow{2}{*}{$A$} & $<f$ &
      \multicolumn{2}{c}{\multirow{2}{*}{%  
         \begin{tabular}{|p{8mm}|p{8mm}|}  
             \hline
              &  \\  
             \hline
              &  \\  
             \hline
         \end{tabular}
      }}
                              \\   
                     & $>f$ & &
\end{tabular}

\noindent By reasoning about your equation from part a, determine which
of these are possible and which are not.
