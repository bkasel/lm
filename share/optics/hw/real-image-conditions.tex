Zahra likes to play practical jokes on the friends she goes
hiking with. One night, by a blazing camp fire, she stealthily
uses a lens of focal length $f$ to gather light from the fire
and make a hot spot on Becky's neck. (a) 
m4_ifelse(__problems,1,[:Draw:],[:Using the method of section __bare_subsection_or_section(other-curved-mirrors),
p.~__pageref_subsection_or_section(other-curved-mirrors), draw:])
a ray diagram and
set up the equation for the
image location, inferring the correct plus and minus signs
from the diagram. (b) Let $A$ be the distance from the lens to
the campfire, and $B$ the distance from the lens to Becky's
neck. Consider the following nine possibilities:

\begin{tabular}{llp{11mm}p{11mm}p{11mm}}
 & & \multicolumn{2}{c}{$\qquad\qquad B$} \\
                     & &  $\quad <f$ &  $\quad =f$  & $\quad >f$ \\
\multirow{3}{*}{$A$} & $<f$ &
      \multicolumn{3}{c}{\multirow{3}{*}{%
         \begin{tabular}{|p{11mm}|p{11mm}|p{11mm}|}
             \hline
              & &  \\
             \hline
              & &  \\
             \hline
              & &  \\
             \hline
         \end{tabular}
      }}
                              \\                                                                                 
                     & $=f$ & &    \\
                     & $>f$ & &
\end{tabular}

\noindent By reasoning about your equation from part a, determine which
of these are possible and which are not.
