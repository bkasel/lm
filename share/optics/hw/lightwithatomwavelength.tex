Estimate the frequency of an electromagnetic wave whose
wavelength is similar in size to an atom (about a nm).
m4_ifelse(__problems,1,[:In:],[:Referring back to figure \figref{em-spectrum} on p.~\pageref{fig:em-spectrum}, in:])
what part of the electromagnetic spectrum would such a wave
lie (infrared, gamma-rays, \ldots)?
