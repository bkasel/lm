The figure shows a diffraction pattern made by a double
slit, along with an image of a meter stick to show the
scale. Sketch the diffraction pattern from the figure on your
paper. Now consider the four variables in the equation
$\lambda /d=\sin \theta /m$. Which of these are the same
for all five fringes, and which are different for each
fringe? Which variable would you naturally use in order to
label which fringe was which? Label the fringes on your
sketch using the values of that variable.
