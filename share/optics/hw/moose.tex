Here's a game my kids like to play. I sit next to a sunny
window, and the sun reflects from the glass on my watch,
making a disk of light on the wall or floor, which they
pretend to chase as I move it around. Is the spot a disk
because that's the shape of the sun, or because it's the
shape of my watch? In other words, would a square watch make
a square spot, or do we just have a circular image of the
circular sun, which will be circular no matter what?
