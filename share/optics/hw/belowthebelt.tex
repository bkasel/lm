If a mirror on a wall is only big enough for you to see
yourself from your head down to your waist, can you see your
entire body by backing up? Test this experimentally and
come up with an explanation for your observations,
including a ray diagram.

Note that when you do the experiment, it's easy to confuse
yourself if the mirror is even a tiny bit off of vertical.
One way to check yourself is to artificially lower the top
of the mirror by putting a piece of tape or a post-it note
where it blocks your view of the top of your head. You can
then check whether you are able to see more of yourself both
above \emph{and} below by backing up.
