<% hw_solution %> (a) A converging mirror with a focal length of 20 cm
is used to create an image, using an object at a distance of
10 cm. Is the image real, or is it virtual? (b) How about
$f=20$ cm and $d_o=30$ cm? (c) What if it was a \emph{diverging}
mirror with $f=20$ cm and $d_o=10$ cm? (d) A diverging
mirror with $f=20$ cm and $d_o=30$ cm?
