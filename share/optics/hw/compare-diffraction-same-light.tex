<% hw_solution %> The figure below shows two diffraction patterns, both
made with the same wavelength of red light. (a) What type of
slits made the patterns? Is it a single slit, double slits,
or something else? Explain. (b) Compare the dimensions of
the slits used to make the top and bottom pattern. Give a
numerical ratio, and state which way the ratio is, i.e.,
which slit pattern was the larger one. Explain.
