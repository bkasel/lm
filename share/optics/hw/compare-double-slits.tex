<% hw_solution %> The figure below shows three diffraction patterns. All
were made under identical conditions, except that a
different set of double slits was used for each one. The
slits used to make the top pattern had a center-to-center
separation $d=0.50$ mm, and each slit was $w=0.04$ mm wide.
(a) Determine $d$ and $w$ for the slits used to make the
pattern in the middle. (b) Do the same for the slits used to
make the bottom pattern.
