The following is a graph of the height of a water wave as
a function of \emph{position}, at a certain moment in time.

<%
  fig(
    'hw-sine-wave',
    '',
    {
      'width'=>'wide',
      'anonymous'=>true,
      'float'=>false
    }
  )
%>

Trace this graph onto another piece of paper, and then
sketch below it the corresponding graphs that would be obtained if

(a) the amplitude and frequency were doubled while the
velocity remained the same;

(b) the frequency and velocity were both doubled while the
amplitude remained unchanged;

(c) the wavelength and amplitude were reduced by a factor of
three while the velocity was doubled.

\emph{Explain all your answers.}
