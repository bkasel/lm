(a) Pendulum 2 has a string twice as long as pendulum 1.
If we define $x$ as the distance traveled by the bob along a
circle away from the bottom, how does the $k$ of pendulum 2
compare with the $k$ of pendulum 1? Give a numerical ratio.
[Hint: the total force on the bob is the same if the angles
away from the bottom are the same, but equal angles do not
correspond to equal values of $x$.]

(b) Based on your answer from part (a), how does the period
of pendulum 2 compare with the period of pendulum 1?
Give a numerical ratio.
