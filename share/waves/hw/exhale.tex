Your exhaled breath contains about 4.5\% carbon dioxide,
and is therefore more dense than fresh air by about 2.3\%.
By analogy with the treatment of waves on a string in
section \ref{sec:waves-on-a-string}, we expect that the speed of sound will be
inversely proportional to the square root of the density of
the gas. Calculate the effect on the frequency produced
by a wind instrument.
