The figure shows one wavelength of a steady sinusoidal
wave traveling to the right along a string. Define a
coordinate system in which the positive $x$ axis points to
the right and the positive $y$ axis up, such that the
flattened string would have $y=0$. Copy the figure, and
label with $y=0$ all the appropriate parts of the
string. Similarly, label with $v=0$ all parts of the
string whose velocities are zero, and with $a=0$ all
parts whose accelerations are zero. There is more than one
point whose velocity is of the greatest magnitude. Pick one
of these, and indicate the direction of its velocity vector.
Do the same for a point having the maximum magnitude of acceleration.
Explain all your answers.
