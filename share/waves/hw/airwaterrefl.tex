(a) Compute the amplitude of light that is reflected back into
air at an air-water interface, relative to the amplitude of
the incident wave. Assume that the light arrives in the direction
directly perpendicular to the surface.The speeds of light in air and water are
$3.0\times10^8$ and $2.2\times10^8$ m/s, respectively.\hwendpart
(b) Find the energy of the reflected wave as a fraction of
the incident energy.
