(a) A wave pulse moves into a new medium, where its velocity is greater
by a factor $\alpha$. Find an expression for the fraction, $f$, of the wave
energy that is transmitted, in terms of $\alpha$. Note that, as discussed
in the text, you cannot simply find $f$ by squaring the amplitude of the
transmitted wave. <% hw_answer %>\hwendpart
(b) Suppose we wish to transmit a pulse
from one medium to another, maximizing the fraction of the wave energy
transmitted.
To do so, we sandwich another layer in between them, so that the
wave moves from the initial medium, where its velocity is $v_1$, through
the intermediate layer, where it is $v_2$, and on into the final layer, where it
becomes $v_3$. What is the optimal value of $v_2$?
(Assume that the middle layer is thicker than the
length of the pulse, so there are no interference effects. Also, although
there will be later echoes that are transmitted after multiple reflections
back and forth across the middle layer, you are only to optimize the
strength of the transmitted pulse that is first to emerge. In other words, it's simply
a matter of applying your answer from part a twice to find the amount
that finally gets through.)
