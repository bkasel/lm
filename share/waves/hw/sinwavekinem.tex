At a particular moment in time, a wave on a string
has a shape described by $y=3.5\cos (0.73\pi x+0.45\pi t+0.37\pi)$. The stuff
inside the cosine is in radians. Assume that the units of the numerical constants
are such that $x$, $y$, and $t$ are in SI units.<% hw_hint("sinwavekinem") %>\hwendpart
(a) Is the wave moving in the positive $x$ or the negative $x$ direction?\hwendpart
(b) Find the wave's period, frequency, wavelength.\hwendpart
(c) Find the wave's velocity. \hwendpart
(d) Find the maximum velocity of any point on the string, and compare with the
magnitude and direction of the wave's velocity. \answercheck
