Neutrinos interact so weakly with normal matter that, of the neutrinos
from the sun that enter the earth from the day side, only about
$10^{-10}$ of them fail to reemerge on the night side. From this fact,
estimate the thickness of matter, in units of light-years,
that would be required in order to block half of them. This ``half-distance''
is analogous to a half-life for radioactive decay.
