The speed, $v$, of an atom in an ideal gas has a probability
distribution of the form
$D(v) = bve^{-cv^2}$,
where $0\le v < \infty$,
$c$ relates to the temperature, and $b$ is determined
by normalization.\\
(a) Sketch the distribution.\\
(b) Find $b$ in terms of $c$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(c) Find the average speed in terms of $c$, eliminating
$b$. (Don't try to do the indefinite
integral, because it can't be done in closed form. The
relevant definite integral can be found in tables or done
with computer software.)\answercheck
