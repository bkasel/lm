On page \pageref{video-electron}, I discussed the idea of hooking up a video
camera to a visible-light microscope and recording the trajectory of an
electron orbiting a nucleus. An electron in an atom typically has a speed
of about 1\% of the speed of light.\\
(a) Calculate the momentum of the electron.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) When we make images with photons, we can't resolve details that are smaller than
the photons' wavelength. Suppose we wanted to map out the trajectory of the electron
with an accuracy of 0.01 nm. What part of the electromagnetic spectrum would we have
to use?\hwendpart
(c)  As found in homework problem \ref{hw:ultrarelativistic} on page \pageref{hw:ultrarelativistic},
the momentum of a photon is given by $p=E/c$. Estimate the momentum of a photon having
the necessary wavelength.\answercheck\hwendpart
(d) Comparing your answers from parts a and c, what would be the effect on the electron if
the photon bounced off of it?
What does this tell you about the possibility of mapping out an electron's orbit around
a nucleus?\hwendpart
