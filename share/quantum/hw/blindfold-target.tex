A blindfolded person fires a gun at a circular target of radius $b$, and is
allowed to continue firing until a shot actually hits it. Any part of the
target is equally likely to get hit. We measure the random distance
$r$ from the center of the circle to where the bullet went in.\\
(a) Show that the probability distribution of $r$ must be of the
form $D(r)=kr$, where $k$ is some constant. (Of course we have
$D(r)=0$ for $r>b$.)\\
(b) Determine $k$ by requiring $D$ to be properly normalized.\answercheck\hwendpart
(c) Find the average value of $r$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(d) Interpreting your result from part c, how does it compare with
$b/2$? Does this make sense? Explain.
