When light is reflected from a mirror, perhaps only 80\%
of the energy comes back. One could try to explain this in
two different ways: (1) 80\% of the photons are reflected,
or (2) all the photons are reflected, but each loses 20\% of
its energy. Based on your everyday knowledge about mirrors,
how can you tell which interpretation is correct? [Based on
a problem from PSSC Physics.]
