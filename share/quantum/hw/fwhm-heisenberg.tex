The Heisenberg uncertainty principle, $\Delta p \Delta x \gtrsim h$, can only be
made into a strict inequality if we agree on a rigorous mathematical definition
of $\Delta x$ and $\Delta p$. Suppose we define the deltas in terms of the
full width at half maximum (FWHM), which we first encountered on p.~\pageref{fwhm}
and revisited on page \pageref{fwhm-recap} of this book. Now consider the lowest-energy
state of the one-dimensional particle in a box. As argued on page
\pageref{delta-p-heisenberg}, the momentum has equal probability of being
$h/L$ or $-h/L$, so the FWHM definition gives $\Delta p=2h/L$.\\
(a) Find $\Delta x$ using the FWHM definition. Keep in mind that the probability
distribution depends on the square of the wavefunction.\hwendpart
(b) Find $\Delta x \Delta p$.\answercheck
