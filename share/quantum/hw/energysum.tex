Before the quantum theory, experimentalists noted that in
many cases, they would find three lines in the spectrum of
the same atom that satisfied the following mysterious rule:
$1/\lambda_1=1/\lambda_2+1/\lambda_3$. Explain why this
would occur.  Do not use reasoning that only works for
hydrogen --- such combinations occur in the spectra of all
elements. [Hint: Restate the equation in terms of the
energies of photons.]
