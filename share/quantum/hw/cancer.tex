The photoelectric effect can occur not just for metal
cathodes but for any substance, including living tissue. 
Ionization of DNA molecules can cause cancer or birth
defects. If the energy required to ionize DNA is on the same
order of magnitude as the energy required to produce the
photoelectric effect in a metal, which of the following types of
electromagnetic waves might pose such a hazard? Explain.

\begin{tabular}{l}
                60 Hz waves from power lines\\
                100 MHz FM radio\\
                microwaves from a microwave oven\\
                visible light\\
                ultraviolet light\\
                x-rays
\end{tabular}
