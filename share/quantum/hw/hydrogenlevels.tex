The figure shows eight of the possible ways in which an
electron in a hydrogen atom could drop from a higher energy
state to a state of lower energy, releasing the difference
in energy as a photon. Of these eight transitions, only D,
E, and F produce photons with wavelengths in the visible
spectrum.\\
 (a) Which of the visible transitions would be
closest to the violet end of the spectrum, and which would
be closest to the red end? Explain.\hwendpart
 (b) In what part of the
electromagnetic spectrum would the photons from transitions
A, B, and C lie? What about G and H? Explain.\hwendpart
 (c) Is
there an upper limit to the wavelengths that could be
emitted by a hydrogen atom going from one bound state to
another bound state? Is there a lower limit? Explain.
