Devise a method for testing experimentally the hypothesis
that a gambler's chance of winning at craps is independent
of her previous record of wins and losses. If you don't
invoke the mathematical definition of statistical independence, then you haven't
proposed a test. This has nothing to do with the details of the
rules of craps, or with the fact that it's a game played using dice.
