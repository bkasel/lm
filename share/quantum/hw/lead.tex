Use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to estimate the
minimum velocity of a proton or neutron in a $^{208}\zu{Pb}$
nucleus, which has a diameter of about 13 fm (1 fm=$10^{-15}$
 m). Assume that the speed is nonrelativistic, and then
check at the end whether this assumption was warranted.\answercheck
