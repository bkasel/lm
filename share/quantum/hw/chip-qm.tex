A free electron that contributes to the current in an
ohmic material typically has a speed of $10^5$  m/s (much
greater than the drift velocity).\hwendpart
(a) Estimate its de Broglie wavelength, in nm.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) If a computer memory chip contains $10^8$  electric
circuits in a 1 $\zu{cm}^2$ area, estimate the linear size, in
nm, of one such circuit.\answercheck\hwendpart
(c) Based on your answers from parts a and b, does an
electrical engineer designing such a chip need to worry
about wave effects such as diffraction?\hwendpart
(d) Estimate the maximum number of electric circuits that
can fit on a 1 $\zu{cm}^2$ computer chip before quantum-mechanical
effects become important.
