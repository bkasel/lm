\emph{This problem builds on the results of problems \ref{ch:quantum}-\ref{hw:particleinabox}
(p.~\pageref{hw:particleinabox}) and \ref{ch:quantum}-\ref{hw:three-d-box}
(p.~\pageref{hw:three-d-box}).}\\
Suppose we have a three-dimensional box of dimensions $L\ \times\ L\ \times\ L/2$.
Let the box be oriented so that the shorter dimension is along the $z$ direction.
For convenience, define the quantity $\epsilon=h^2/8mL^2$, which has units of energy.\\
(a) What are the five lowest energies allowed in this box, expressed in terms of
$\epsilon$? Give the quantum numbers for each energy,
and find the degeneracy (p.~\pageref{subsubsec:degeneracy}) of each.\hwendpart
(b) Suppose we put five electrons in this box such that they have the lowest
possible total energy. (Keep in
mind that there is a limit to how many electrons can have the same spatial wavefunction.) What is the
total energy of this state?\answercheck\hwendpart
(c) What are the two lowest-energy photons that can excite one of the five electrons (from the situation
described in part b) to an excited state?\answercheck\hwendpart
