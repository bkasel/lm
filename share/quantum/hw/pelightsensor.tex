Suppose we want to build an electronic light sensor using
an apparatus
m4_ifelse(__problems,1,[:in which the light strikes a metal plate and generates a current through the photoelectric effect.:],[:like the one described in __subsection_or_section(how-much-light-is-one-photon)
on p.~__pageref_subsection_or_section(how-much-light-is-one-photon).:]) How would its ability to detect
different parts of the spectrum depend on the type of metal
used in the capacitor plates?
