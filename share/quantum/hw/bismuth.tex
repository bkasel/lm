Physicists thought for a long time that bismuth-209 was
the heaviest stable isotope. (Very heavy elements decay by
alpha emission because of the strong electrical repulsion of
all their protons.) However, a 2003 paper by Marcillac et
al. describes an experiment in which bismuth-209 lost its
claim to fame --- it actually undergoes alpha decay with a
half-life of $1.9\times10^{19}$  years.\hwendpart
(a) After the alpha particle is emitted, what is the isotope left over?\hwendpart
(b) Compare the half-life to the age of the universe, which
is about 14 billion years.\hwendpart
(c) A tablespoon of Pepto-Bismol contains about $4\times10^{20}$
bismuth-209 atoms. Once you've swallowed it, how much time
will it take, on the average, before the first atomic decay?\answercheck\hwendpart
