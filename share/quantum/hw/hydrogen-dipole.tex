Consider a classical model of the hydrogen atom in which
the electron orbits the proton in a circle at constant
speed. In this model, the electron and proton can have no
intrinsic spin. Using the result of problem 14 in ch.~24,
show that in this model, the atom's magnetic dipole
moment $D_m$ is related to its angular momentum by
$D_m=(-e/2m)L$, regardless of the details of the orbital
motion. Assume that the magnetic field is the same as would
be produced by a circular current loop, even though there is
really only a single charged particle. [Although the model
is quantum-mechanically incorrect, the result turns out to
give the correct quantum mechanical value for the contribution
to the atom's dipole moment coming from the electron's
orbital motion. There are other contributions, however,
arising from the intrinsic spins of the electron and proton.]
