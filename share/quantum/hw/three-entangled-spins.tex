An entangled state of three particles is prepared, described by the 
wavefunction,
\begin{equation*}
  \Psi = k\left[
     -2|\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\rangle 
    +2i|\uparrow\downarrow\uparrow\rangle 
    +|\downarrow\downarrow\downarrow\rangle
  \right]
\end{equation*}
where the arrows are the $z$-components of the spins of particles A, B, and C, respectively.\\
%
(a) The wavefunction is not properly normalized.
What value of $|k|$ will normalize the wavefunction?\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(b) What is the probability that measuring the $z$-component of 
particle A's spin will give spin up?\answercheck\hwendpart
%
(c) Suppose that we first measure the spin of particle C and find that it is down,
and then we measure the spin of particle A. What is the probability that we will
find A's spin to be up?\answercheck\hwendpart
