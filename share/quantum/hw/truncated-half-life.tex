We are given some atoms of a certain radioactive isotope, with
half-life $t_{1/2}$. We pick one atom at random, and observe it
for one half-life, starting at time zero. If it decays during
that one-half-life period, we record the time $t$ at which the
decay occurred. If it doesn't, we reset our clock to zero and keep
trying until we get an atom that cooperates. The final result
is a time $0\le t\le t_{1/2}$, with a distribution that looks
like the usual exponential decay curve, but with its tail chopped
off.\\
(a) Find the distribution $D(t)$, with the proper normalization.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Find the average value of $t$.\answercheck\hwendpart
(c) Interpreting your result from part b, how does it compare
with $t_{1/2}/2$? Does this make sense? Explain.
