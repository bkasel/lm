This problem refers to the analysis of the ammonia molecule in
sec.~\ref{subsec:qm-ammonia}, p.~\pageref{subsec:qm-ammonia}.

(a) The bond lengths in this molecule are on the order of $0.1\
\zu{nm}$. Use this fact to estimate the moment of inertia for rotation
about the symmetry axis, and verify that states with $L_z>0$ are
likely to be populated at room temperature.\\

(b) The original 1955 paper by Townes and Schawlow on the microwave
spectroscopy of ammonia detected about 55 lines lying between 17 and
29 GHz. Each of these corresponds to a certain value of $L$ and $L_z$.
Since there are many lines crowded together in this region of the
spectrum, the issue arises of whether the resolution of the experiment
will be sufficient to distinguish them. One of the factors limiting
the resolution is that the molecules of ammonia gas have velocities
that are random and randomly oriented, and this causes random Doppler
shifts in the lines. Estimate the Doppler shifts at room temperature
and determine whether or not they are likely to cause problems.
