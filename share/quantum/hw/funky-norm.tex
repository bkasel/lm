Suppose that we replace the usual probability
rule of quantum mechanics with one of the form $P \propto |\langle\Psi|\Psi\rangle|^M$,
with $M>2$. Suppose $M=4$. Show, by considering the example in discussion question \ref{dq:qm-cons-of-prob} on p.~\pageref{dq:qm-cons-of-prob},
that this leads to nonconservation of probability.
