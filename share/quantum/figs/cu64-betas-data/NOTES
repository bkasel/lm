64Cu is nice because:
  - decays by both beta+ and beta-, with similar Q
  - no gammas

analysis that went into my spreadsheets
  It's relativistically exact that p=qBr. See SR 4.5.2 and problem 4-25.
  Cook labels the x axis as Hr, which is a momentum axis.
  p_SI = 10^-6 e H_gauss r_cm
  To convert dN/dp to dN/dK, we need to multiply by dp/dK.
    m^2=E^2-p^2, so dp/dR=E/p.

  "It should be noted, however, that the more
  recent experiments of Albert and Wu 5 - 6 with thinner
  sources and source backings have shown that these dis-
  crepancies are in part due to scattering of the higher
  energy electrons in the source and backing."
