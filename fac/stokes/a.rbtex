The table below is a round-up of the basics of vector calculus from this book.
All of this has been presented earlier, with the exception of the full statement of Stokes's theorem,
which was given in sec.~\ref{sec:something-is-missing}, p.~\pageref{sec:something-is-missing},
only for the special case of a ``conservative'' field, i.e., one whose curl is zero. If you're
a science or engineering major in the US, then most likely you are now at the end of a semester
in which you're taking this electricity and magnetism course concurrently with a vector calculus
course, in which this material has been presented in more depth.

The big picture is that we have three different derivative operators, which take
as input either a scalar-valued function or a vector-valued one, and similarly
for their outputs. For each of these, there is a theorem that has the same structure
as the fundamental theorem of calculus. The familiar version of the fundamental theorem, from
a first-semester calculus course, says that if you integrate a function over some
interval, the result is related to the function's properties on the end-points of
that interval (it equals the difference between the values of the antiderivative
at the end-points). These two end-points constitute the \emph{boundary} of the line segment
representing this interval on the real-number line, i.e., if an ant stands on the
$x$ axis at some point inside this interval, and it wants to get out, it is going to
have to walk past one of the end-points. For each of the three operators of vector
calculus, we have a fundamental theorem with a similar structure: the integral over
a region is related to what's going on at the boundary of the region.

In the following three examples we demonstrate how this works for each of the three
operators when applied to Maxwell's equations, which are recapitulated in the side-bar
for convenient reference.

\begin{eg}{The potential and the electric field}
The fundamental theorem of calculus for the gradient is
\begin{equation*}
  \int \operatorname{grad}\phi\cdot\der\bell = \phi_B-\phi_A,
\end{equation*}
where the integral is along a path from A to B.
If we let $\phi$ be an electric potential, then the corresponding
electric field is $\vc{E}=-\operatorname{grad}\phi$. We then have
\begin{equation*}
  -\int \vc{E}\cdot\der\bell = \phi_B-\phi_A,
\end{equation*}
which is a statement that the difference in potential read by a voltmeter
equals the work per unit charge that would have to be done to
move the charge from A to B, against the field. The field on the
interior of the path is related to the potential on the boundary (end-points A and B).
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{A static electric field}
The fundamental theorem of calculus for the curl, i.e., Stokes's theorem, is
\begin{equation*}
  \int \operatorname{curl}\vc{F}\cdot\der\vc{A} = \int\vc{F}\cdot\der\bell,
\end{equation*}
where the integral on the left is over a surface, and the one on the right is taken as we travel
around the boundary, i.e., the edge of the surface.
One of Maxwell's equations states that $\operatorname{curl}\vc{E} =  -\partial\vc{B}/\partial t$.
For a static field, there is no time variation, so $\operatorname{curl}\vc{E}=0$. We then have
\begin{equation*}
  0 = \int\vc{E}\cdot\der\bell.
\end{equation*}
This is a statement that for static fields, the work done by the electric field around a closed
loop is always zero, as required by conservation of energy.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Electric field and charge density}
The fundamental theorem of calculus for the divergence, i.e., Gauss's theorem, is
\begin{equation*}
  \int \operatorname{div}\vc{F}\:\der v =\int\vc{F}\cdot\der\vc{A},
\end{equation*}
where the left-hand integral is over a volume of space, and the one on the right is over the surface
that constitutes the boundary of that volume. One of Maxwell's equations is 
$\operatorname{div}\vc{E} =  4\pi k\rho$, so we have
\begin{equation*}
  4\pi k \int \rho\:\der v =\int\vc{E}\cdot\der\vc{A}.
\end{equation*}
This is just Gauss's law, which relates the total charge inside the region to the flux out through
its boundary.

The only new thing here is Stokes's theorem for the case where the curl is not zero,
\begin{equation*}
  \int \operatorname{curl}\vc{F}\cdot\der\vc{A} = \int\vc{F}\cdot\der\bell
\end{equation*}
The integral on the right is cometimes referred to as the circulation of the field $\vc{F}$
around a certain closed loop, and in order to define the sign of this circulation, we have
to set an orientation for the loop. For example,  in figure
\subfigref{stokes-handedness}{1}, the arrowhead on the edge of the potato-chip shape
says that we're defining counterclockwise to be the positive direction.

In the integral on the left-hand side, the vector $\der\vc{A}$ is perpendicular to the
surface, as before. This is ambiguous, since there are two opposite directions, each of
which is perpendicular to the surface. In our previous applications of this type of surface integral,
to Gauss's law, we were using a closed surface, so we resolved this ambiguity just by
making our area vectors point outward. Now we're dealing with an open surface, i.e., one
with an edge, which doesn't enclose a volume, so there is no longer an ``outward'' direction.
We therefore define the direction of $\der\vc{A}$ using the right-hand rule shown in 
figure \subfigref{stokes-handedness}{1}. This is the same as the right-hand relationship
we previously used to define the direction of the curl, figure \subfigref{stokes-handedness}{2};
the relationship has to be the same, because we want Stokes's theorem to work in the limit of
infinitely small curves.

<% begin_sec("Amp\\`ere's law",4,'amperes-law') %>
If we apply Stokes's theorem to the static magnetic field made by a
current, Maxwell's equation $\operatorname{curl}\vc{B}=(4\pi k/c^2)\vc{j}$
gives
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{4\pi k}{c^2}\int \vc{j}\cdot\der\vc{A} = \int\vc{B}\cdot\der\bell.
\end{equation*}
The integral on the left is just the amount of current passing through the loop, so
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{4\pi k}{c^2}I_\text{through} = \int\vc{B}\cdot\der\bell.
\end{equation*}
This result is known as Amp\`ere's law.\index{Amp\`ere's law}

What is the field inside a long, straight solenoid of length $\ell$ and radius $a$,
and having $N$ loops of wire evenly wound along it, which carry a current $I$\/?

\eganswer
This is an interesting example, because it allows us to get a very good approximation
to the field, but without some experimental input it wouldn't be obvious what approximation
to use. Figure \figref{amperesolenoid}/1 shows what we'd observe by measuring the field
of a real solenoid. The field is nearly constant inside the tube, as long as we stay far
away from the mouths. The field outside is much weaker. For the sake of an approximate
calculation, we can idealize this field as shown in figure \figref{amperesolenoid}/2.
Of the edges of the Amp\`{e}rian surface shown in \figref{amperesolenoid}/3, only AB
contributes to the flux --- there is zero field along CD, and the field is perpendicular
to edges BC and DA. Amp\`{e}re's law gives
\begin{align*}
        &\int\vc{B}\cdot\der\bell = \frac{4\pi k}{ c^2}\, I_{ through} \\

<% begin_sec("Faraday's law",4,'faradays-law') %>
One of Maxwell's equations is $\operatorname{curl}\vc{E} =  -\partial\vc{B}/\partial t$.
This states that a varying magnetic field induces a curly electric field (sec.~\ref{sec:maxwell-vacuum},
p.~\pageref{sec:maxwell-vacuum}), and we've used it in the analysis of electromagnetic waves
as well as in the qualitative description of an electric generator.
Application of Stokes's theorem to this equation gives
\begin{equation*}
  - \int \frac{\partial\vc{B}}{\partial t}\cdot\der\vc{A} = \int\vc{E}\cdot\der\bell.
\end{equation*}
We're now going to rewrite the left-hand side to put it in a form where it
talks about the magnetic flux through the surface. The idea here is that we can
interchange the order of the integral and the time derivative, like
$\int \frac{\partial}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\int$. This is a valid step
because an integral is a kind of sum, and the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals.
This makes the left-hand side into $-\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\int \vc{B}\cdot\der\vc{A}$,
but $\int \vc{B}\cdot\der\vc{A}$ is just the magnetic flux $\Phi_B$ through the surface. We therefore
have
\begin{equation*}
  - \frac{\partial\Phi_B}{\partial t} = \int\vc{E}\cdot\der\bell.
\end{equation*}
That is, when a changing magnetic field induces a curly electric field, the circulation
of the electric field around a closed loop equals minus the rate at which the
magnetic flux through the loop is changing. This is called Faraday's law.

Michael Faraday, whom we met on p.~\pageref{faraday-intro-bio},\index{Faraday, Michael}
worked before Maxwell's, so he didn't derive his result from Maxwell's equations --- it
was the other way around, with Maxwell putting together Faraday's work on induction along with some
other known ingredients to create Maxwell's equations. Faraday never learned calculus, trigonometry,
or any math beyond the most basic algebra, so he probably visualized what we now call Faraday's
law as shown in figure \figref{flux-linkage}. 

<% marg(20) %>
<%
  fig(
    'flux-linkage',
    %q{%
      The bar magnet makes some magnetic flux through an imaginary disk (white).
    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

As the magnet moves from 1 to 2, the flux through the imaginary disk increases. Faraday's law predicts that
a curly electric field will be produced, and it predicts its circulation
$\int\vc{E}\cdot\der\bell$ around the edge of the disk to be equal to
minus the rate of change of the flux. This electric field exists regardless of whether there is
anything physically present at our imaginary disk, but if we happen to have placed a circular loop
of wire there, and we connect it to a voltmeter or an oscilloscope, we will measure
a voltage, given by the integral defining the circulation
of the electric field. The figure only shows a two-dimensional picture of a small
number of magnetic field lines, but subject to this crude approximation, we could say that
the number of field lines passing through the disk has doubled, from 2 to 4. This tells us
how much the magnetic flux has increased.

The only way for this number of field lines to change is if the
field lines and the loop cut through each other, as in the stage magic trick where a magician
passes one steel ring through another, linking them like a chain. For this reason, the flux
passing through the disk can be referred to as the \emph{flux linkage}. The induction effect
predicted by Faraday's law is proportional to the rate at which the field lines are cutting through
the loop.

For ease of visualization, I drew the surface in figure \figref{flux-linkage} as
a simple disk, whose boundary is a circle. If we were to form this circle from a loop
of wire and connect it to an oscilloscope, as in figure \figref{practical-faraday},
the signal would probably be easily detectable. But as an electric generator, this
is still somewhat impractical. The strength
of the effect can be increased greatly by replacing the single loop with a coil.
In example \ref{eg:amperesolenoid} on p.~\pageref{eg:amperesolenoid}, we saw that when we
use a current in a coil of wire to \emph{create} a magnetic field, the effect was proportional
to the number of turns of wire per unit length. Something similar is true when we \emph{expose} a coil of wire
to a \emph{changing} magnetic field, in order to produce a voltage. The effect is again proportional to
the number of turns of wire.

The easy way to visualize this is in terms of flux linkage and
the cutting of the magnetic field lines across the wire. In figure \figref{finger-two-loops},
the finger represents the magnetic field, and the cord represents the boundary of the
imaginary surface used in Faraday's law. In applications, the cord could be a piece of wire.
It is obvious that if the finger (magnetic field line) is to pass through the cord like a ghost, it will
have to make twice as many cuts through in the case where the cord is wrapped in two loops.
Since the induction effect is proportional to the number of cuts, it is doubled.

The proportionality to the number of loops is not an exception or modification to Faraday's
law, and we don't have to appeal to the ``cutting'' interpretation to explain it if we don't
want to. Figure \figref{bear-paws} shows the transformation of a single loop to a double one.
During this process, the surface is like a soap
bubble suspended across the wire that forms the boundary. The surface is never torn or glued together.
Although I find it a little difficult to visualize the final ``soap bubble'' surface, it is clearly
true that each field line will pass through the surface twice, producing twice the flux compared to
a single circular loop with the same circumference.

When we obtained Faraday's law from Maxwell's equations and Stokes's theorem, we assumed
implicitly that once we picked a surface, it stayed the same. The only change over time
was the change in the magnetic field. But clearly if we viewed the situation in another frame
of reference, the surface would be moving, and we expect our laws of physics to be valid
regardless of the frame of reference. It is OK for the surface to move, and it can even
change size or shape. This is intuitively appealing if we think of the ``cutting'' interpretation.

Faraday arrived at what we now call Faraday's law completely empirically. It's
fascinating to read about the original trail of evidence that he followed.
Figure \figref{faraday} is a simplified drawing of a crucial experiment,
as described in his original paper:
``Two hundred and three feet of copper wire \ldots were passed round a large block
of wood; [another] two hundred and three feet of similar wire were interposed
as a spiral between the turns of the first, and metallic contact everywhere
prevented by twine [insulation]. One of these [coils] was connected
with a galvanometer [voltmeter], and the other with a battery\ldots When the
contact was made, there was a sudden and very slight effect at the galvanometer,
and there was also a similar slight effect when the contact with the battery
was broken. But whilst the \ldots current was continuing to pass through the one
[coil], no  \ldots effect \ldots upon the other [coil] could be perceived,
although the active power of the battery was proved to be great, by its heating
the whole of its own coil [through ordinary resistive heating] \ldots''

From Faraday's notes and publications, it appears that the situation in figure
\figref{faraday}/3 was a surprise to him, and he probably thought it would be
a surprise to his readers, as well. That's why he offered evidence that the
current was still flowing: to show that the battery hadn't just died.
The induction effect occurred during the short time it took for the black coil's
magnetic field to be established, \figref{faraday}/2. Even more counterintuitively,
we get an effect, equally strong but in the opposite direction, when the circuit
is \emph{broken}, \figref{faraday}/4. The effect occurs only when the magnetic field
is changing, and it appears to be proportional to the derivative
\emph{rate of change} of the magnetic flux through the block (or actually through
the corkscrew-shaped surface formed by the white wire), which has
one sign when the field is
being established, and in the opposite direction when it collapses.

Although Faraday's discovery was empirical, Faraday's law has close logical
interrelationships with other principles of physics. In example \ref{eg:short-inductor}
we see that induction is necessary based on conservation of energy, and in example
\ref{eg:inductionrel} that it is necessary based on the fact that motion is relative.

\pagebreak

\begin{eg}{Conservation of energy}\label{eg:short-inductor}
Figure \subfigref{short-inductor}{1} shows a solenoid with a current being driven through it
by a battery. The wire that the solenoid is made of has some finite resistance, so this
is not a short circuit, but current is flowing. There is a magnetic field in and around the
solenoid. The magnetic compass near the mouth of the solenoid is nearly aligned with the
solenoid's axis, showing that this field is much stronger than
any ambient field such as the earth's. 

So far there has been no obvious reason for having the two variable resistors. The one
set to $R=0$ might as well be a piece of wire, and the one set to $R=\infty$ could just be
air. But now suppose that we rapidly change the resistors so that they have the values
shown in \subfigref{short-inductor}{2}. In fact, I have a power supply in my lab that
seems to do essentially this when I flip its switch to the ``off'' position.

If our intuition is based solely
on experience with DC circuits, then we would expect that the current would instantly cease.
The resistance that is now infinite is an open circuit, which means that the power supply
is disconnected from the circuit. We have shorted across the inductor, and we know that if
we short across a lightbulb, it just winks out.

But that is not at all what happens. The compass stays aligned with the solenoid, showing
that the field still exists. Only very slowly does it relax to alignment with the direction
of the ambient field.

Although this is a little surprising, it becomes easier to understand when we consider that
the field in circuit 1 had energy. Therefore the field can't just go poof.
It has to have some mechanism for transforming that energy into some other form. The only
mechanism available for doing that is resistive heating in the coil. But this
will take some time, as measured by the RL time constant of circuit 2. During this time,
the field and the current just gradually die out.

To push this current through the circuit, which has some resistance, we will need an
electric field, even though the battery has been taken out of action. This electric field
exists due to Faraday's law, and the minus sign in Faraday's law is interpreted as saying
that the field is in the direction that tends to resist the change in the magnetic field.

\begin{eg}{Frames of reference}\label{eg:inductionrel}
In figure \figref{inductionrel}, flea 1 doesn't believe in this
modern foolishness about induction. She's sitting on the bar magnet, which to her is
obviously at rest. As the square wire loop is dragged away from her and the magnet,
its protons experience a force out of the page, because the cross product
$\vc{F}=q\vc{v}\times\vc{B}$ is out of the page. The electrons, which are negatively
charged, feel a force into the page. The conduction electrons are free to move, but the
protons aren't. In the front and back sides of the loop, this force is perpendicular
to the wire. In the right and left sides, however, the electrons are free to respond to the force.
Note that the magnetic field is weaker on the right side. It's as though we had
two pumps in a loop of pipe, with the weaker pump trying to push in the opposite direction; the
weaker pump loses the argument.\footnote{If the pump analogy makes you uneasy, consider what would happen if all the electrons
moved into the page on both sides of the loop. We'd end up with a net negative charge at the
back side, and a net positive charge on the front. This actually would happen in the first
nanosecond after the loop was set in motion. This buildup of charge would start to quench
both currents due to electrical forces,
but the current in the right side of the wire, which is driven by the weaker
magnetic field, would be the first to stop. Eventually, an equilibrium will be reached
in which the same amount of current is flowing at every point around the loop, and no more
charge is being piled up.}
We get a current that circulates around the 
loop.\footnote{The wire is not a perfect conductor, so this current produces
heat. The energy required to produce this heat comes from the hands, which are doing
mechanical work as they separate the magnet from the loop.} There
is no induction going on in this frame of reference; the forces that cause the current are
just the ordinary magnetic forces experienced by any charged particle moving through
a magnetic field.

Flea 2 is sitting on the loop, which she considers to be at rest.
In her frame of reference, it's the bar magnet that is moving. Like flea 1, she
observes a current circulating around the loop, but unlike flea 1, she
cannot use magnetic forces to explain this current. As far as she is concerned, the
electrons were initially at rest. Magnetic forces are forces between moving charges
and other moving charges, so a magnetic field can never accelerate a charged particle
starting from rest. A force that accelerates a charge from rest can only be an
\emph{electric} force, so she is forced to conclude that there is an electric field
in her region of space. This field drives electrons
around and around in circles, so it is apparently violating the loop rule --- it is
a curly field. What reason can flea 2
offer for the existence of this electric field pattern? Well, she's been noticing that
the magnetic field in her region of space has been changing, possibly because that bar
magnet over there has been getting farther away. She observes that a changing magnetic
field creates a curly electric field.

We therefore conclude that induction effects \emph{must} exist based on the fact that
motion is relative. If we didn't want to admit induction effects, we would have to
outlaw flea 2's frame of reference, but the whole idea of relative motion is that
all frames of reference are created equal, 
and there is no way to determine which one is really at rest.
