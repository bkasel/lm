In a mechanical oscillation, energy is exchanged repetitively
between potential and kinetic forms, and may also be
siphoned off in the form of heat dissipated by friction. In
an electrical circuit, resistors are the circuit elements
that dissipate heat. What are the electrical analogs of
storing and releasing the potential and kinetic energy of a
vibrating object? When you think of energy storage in an
electrical circuit, you are likely to imagine a battery, but
even rechargeable batteries can only go through 10 or 100
cycles before they wear out. In addition, batteries are not
able to exchange energy on a short enough time scale for
most applications. The circuit in a musical synthesizer may
be called upon to oscillate thousands of times a second, and
your microwave oven operates at gigahertz frequencies.
Instead of batteries, we generally use
capacitors and
inductors to store energy in oscillating circuits. Capacitors,
which you've already encountered, store energy in electric fields.
An inductor does the same with magnetic fields.

<% begin_sec("Capacitors") %>

A capacitor's energy exists in its surrounding electric
fields. It is proportional to the square of the field
strength, which is proportional to the charges on the
plates. If we assume the plates carry charges that are the
same in magnitude, $+q$ and $-q$, then the energy stored in
the capacitor must be proportional to $q^2$. For historical
reasons, we write the constant of proportionality as $1/2C$, 
\begin{equation*}
                U_C    =   \frac{1}{2C}q^2\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
The constant $C$ is a geometrical property of the
capacitor, called its capacitance.

Based on this definition, the units of capacitance must be
coulombs squared per joule, and this combination is more
conveniently abbreviated as the farad\index{farad!defined},
$1\ \zu{F}=1\ \zu{C}^2/\zu{J}$.
``Condenser'' is a less formal term
for a capacitor. Note that the labels printed on capacitors
often use MF to mean $\mu\zu{F}$, even though MF should really
be the symbol for megafarads, not microfarads. Confusion
doesn't result from this nonstandard notation, since
picofarad and microfarad values are the most common, and it
wasn't until the 1990's that even millifarad and farad
values became available in practical physical sizes. Figure
\figref{capsymbol} shows the symbol used in schematics
to represent a capacitor.

\begin{eg}{A parallel-plate capacitor}\label{eg:capparplate}
\egquestion
Suppose a capacitor consists of two parallel metal plates with
area $A$, and the gap between them is $h$. The gap is small
compared to the dimensions of the plates. What is the
capacitance?

\eganswer
Using the result of problem \ref{hw:capacitor-field},
$E=4\pi k\sigma=4\pi kq/ A$. 
The energy stored in the field is $U_{e} = (1/8\pi k) E^2 Ah$. Substituting the
first expression into the second, we find $U_{e}=2\pi kq^2 h/ A$.
Comparing this to the definition of capacitance, we end up with $C=A/4\pi kh$.

If you look at the printed circuit board in a typical piece
of consumer electronics, there are many capacitors, often placed fairly close together.
Life is a made a lot simpler by the fact that each capacitor's field tends to be
concentrated on its own interior.
If their exterior fields are not so small, then each capacitor interacts
with its neighbors in a complicated way, and the behavior of the circuit depends
on the exact physical layout, since the interaction would be stronger or weaker depending
on distance. The resulting behavior of the circuit then depends in detail on the three-dimensional
geometry of the circuit, as in figure \figref{capacitors-not-lumped-circuit}.
In reality, a capacitor does create weak external electric fields, but their
effects are often negligible, and we can then use the \emph{lumped-circuit approximation},
\index{lumped-circuit approximation!for capacitors}\label{lumped-circuit-approx}
which states that each component's behavior depends only on the currents that flow in
and out of it, not on the interaction of its fields with the other components.
<% end_sec() %>

<% begin_sec("Inductors") %>

Any current will
create a magnetic field, so in fact every current-carrying
wire in a circuit acts as an inductor! 
However, this type of ``stray'' inductance is typically
negligible, just as we can usually ignore the stray resistance of
our wires and only take into account the actual resistors.
To store any appreciable amount of magnetic energy, one
usually uses a coil of wire designed specifically to be an inductor.
All the loops' contribution to the magnetic field add together
to make a stronger field. Unlike
capacitors and resistors, practical inductors are easy to make by
hand. One can for instance spool some wire around a short wooden dowel.
An inductor like this, in the form cylindrical coil of wire, is called
a solenoid, \figref{coilshapes}, and a stylized solenoid, \figref{indsymbol}, is the
symbol used to represent an inductor in a circuit regardless
of its actual geometry.

How much energy does an inductor store?
The energy density is proportional
to the square of the magnetic field strength, which is in
turn proportional to the current flowing through the
coiled wire, so the energy stored in the inductor must be
proportional to $I^2$. We write $L/2$ for the constant of
proportionality, giving
\begin{equation*}
                U_L    =    \frac{L}{2}I^2\eqquad.  
\end{equation*}

As in the definition of capacitance, we have a
factor of 1/2, which is purely a matter of definition. The
quantity $L$ is called the \emph{inductance}\index{inductance!defined} of the
inductor, and we see that its units must be joules per
ampere squared. This clumsy combination of units is more
commonly abbreviated as the henry, 1 henry = 1 $\zu{J}/\zu{A}^2$.
Rather than memorizing this definition, it makes more sense
to derive it when needed from the definition of inductance.

Many people know inductors simply as ``coils,'' or ``chokes,'' and
will not understand you if you refer to an ``inductor,'' but they will
still refer to $L$ as the ``inductance,'' not the ``coilance'' or
``chokeance!'' The term ``choke'' is derived from the fact that, as
we'll see in sec.~\ref{sec:impedance}, an inductance tends to pass low
frequencies while ``choking off'' high frequencies.  This is the
opposite of a capacitor: a capacitor has vacuum or an insulator
between the plates, and therefore will not pass DC. Therefore
capacitors and inductors are often used as filters to get rid of
certain frequencies in a signal (example
\ref{eg:low-pass-and-high-pass},
p.~\pageref{eg:low-pass-and-high-pass}). If you're listening to music
on a pair of stereo speakers while reading this, then there is
probably a set of filters, called the cross-over filter, that send low
frequencies to the woofers and highs to the tweeters. 

The type of air-core coil described above is a good one for many applications,
such as a stereo speaker's cross-over filter. For other applications, however,
this technology would be too expensive, too bulky to use in miniaturized
electronics, or too hard to integrate into a printed-circuit board. For
some applications, this can be remedied by adding an iron core, while
for others the behavior of an inductor can be achieved using a combination
of transistors (an op-amp) and a capacitor. When we consider the behavior of
these things as circuit elements, the same equations apply regardless of 
the implementation.

There is a lumped circuit approximation for inductors, just like the one
for capacitors (p. \pageref{lumped-circuit-approx}).
For a capacitor, this means assuming that
the electric fields are completely internal, so
that components only interact via currents that flow through wires,
not due to the physical overlapping of their fields in space. Similarly
for an inductor, the lumped circuit approximation is the assumption
that the magnetic fields are completely internal.

\begin{eg}{Identical inductances in series}\label{eg:l-series}
If two inductors are placed in series, any current that
passes through the combined double inductor must pass
through both its parts.
If we assume the lumped circuit approximation, the two inductors' fields
don't interfere with each other, so the energy is doubled for a given current.
Thus by the
definition of inductance, the inductance is doubled as well.
In general, inductances in series add, just like resistances.
The same kind of reasoning also shows that the inductance of
a solenoid is approximately proportional to its length,
assuming the number of turns per unit length is kept
constant. (This is only approximately true, because putting
two solenoids end-to-end causes the fields just outside
their mouths to overlap and add together in a complicated manner.
In other words, the lumped-circuit approximation may not be very
good.)

\begin{eg}{Identical capacitances in parallel}\label{eg:c-parallel}
When two identical capacitances are placed in parallel, any
charge deposited at the terminals of the combined double
capacitor will divide itself evenly between the two parts.
The electric fields surrounding each capacitor will be half
the intensity, and therefore store one quarter the energy.
Two capacitors, each storing one quarter the energy, give
half the total energy storage. Since capacitance is
inversely related to energy storage, this implies that
identical capacitances in parallel give double the
capacitance. In general, capacitances in parallel add. This
is unlike the behavior of inductors and resistors, for which
series configurations give addition.

This is consistent with the result of example \ref{eg:capparplate},
which had the capacitance of a single parallel-plate capacitor
proportional to the area of the plates.
If we have two
parallel-plate capacitors, and we combine them in parallel
and bring them very close together side by side, we have
produced a single capacitor with plates of double the area, and
it has approximately double the capacitance, subject to any
violation of the lumped-circuit approximation due to the interaction
of the fields where the edges of the capacitors are joined together.

\begin{eg}{A variable capacitor}
Figure \figref{variablecap}/1 shows the construction of a
variable capacitor out of two parallel semicircles of metal.
One plate is fixed, while the other can be rotated about
their common axis with a knob. The opposite charges on the
two plates are attracted to one another, and therefore tend
to gather in the overlapping area. This overlapping area,
then, is the only area that effectively contributes to the
capacitance, and turning the knob changes the capacitance.
The simple design can only provide very small capacitance
values, so in practice one usually uses a bank of capacitors,
wired in parallel, with all the moving parts on the same shaft.

\begin{dq}\label{dq:dielectric}
Most practical capacitors do not have an air gap or vacuum gap between the plates; instead,
they have an insulating substance called a dielectric. We can think of the molecules in this substance
as dipoles that are free to rotate (at least a little), but that are not free to move
around, since it is a solid. The figure shows a highly stylized and unrealistic way of
visualizing this. We imagine that all the dipoles are intially turned sideways, (1),
and that as the capacitor is charged, they all respond by turning through a certain angle, (2).
(In reality, the scene might be much more random, and the alignment effect much weaker.)

For simplicity, imagine inserting just one electric dipole
into the vacuum gap. For a given amount of charge on
the plates, how does this affect the amount of
energy stored in the electric field? How does this affect the capacitance?

Now redo the analysis in terms of the mechanical work needed in order to
charge up the plates.

We can analyze it without any sweat or tears whatsoever,
simply by filling in the rest of the system of analogies introduced in sections
\ref{sec:shm}-\ref{sec:damping}, pp.~\pageref{sec:shm}-\pageref{end-sec-shm}, with a mechanical oscillator.
In figure \figref{lrcanalogy}, we have two forms of stored energy,
\begin{align*}
                U_{spring}         &=            \frac{1}{2}kx^2                &(1)  \\
                K                         &=     \frac{1}{2}mv^2\eqquad.        \qquad                &(2)  
\end{align*}
In the circuit, the dissipation of energy
into heat occurs via the resistor, with no mechanical force
involved, so in order to make the analogy, we need to restate
the role of the friction force in terms of energy. The power
dissipated by friction equals the mechanical work it does in
a time interval $\der t$, divided by $\der t$,
$P=W/\der t=F\der x/\der t=Fv=-bv^2$, so
\begin{equation*}
                \text{rate of heat dissipation}  =  -bv^2\eqquad.        \qquad        (3)  
\end{equation*}

<% self_check('lrcsigns',<<-'SELF_CHECK'
Equation (1) has $x$ squared, and equations (2) and (3) have
$v$ squared. Because they're squared, the results don't

In the circuit, the stored forms of energy are
\begin{align*}
                U_C    &=    \frac{1}{2C}q^2                        &(1')  \\
                U_L    &=    \frac{1}{2}LI^2\eqquad, \qquad                        &(2')  
\end{align*}
and the rate of heat dissipation in the resistor is
\begin{equation*}
                \text{rate of heat dissipation}  =  -RI^2\eqquad.        \qquad        (3')  
\end{equation*}
We've previously discussed the analogies
$x\leftrightarrow q$ and $v\leftrightarrow I$.
Next we relate the variables that describe the system's
permanent characteristics:
\begin{align*}
        k        &\leftrightarrow 1/C\\
        m        &\leftrightarrow L\\
        b        &\leftrightarrow R
\end{align*}

Since the mechanical
system naturally oscillates with a frequency
$\omega\approx\sqrt{k/m}$ , we can immediately solve the
electrical version by analogy, giving
\begin{equation*}
          \omega \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

Since the resistance $R$ is analogous to $b$ in the mechanical case, we
find that the $Q$ (quality factor, not charge) of the
resonance is inversely proportional to $R$, and the width of
the resonance is directly proportional to $R$.

\begin{eg}{Tuning a radio receiver}
A radio receiver uses this kind of circuit to pick out the
desired station. Since the receiver resonates at a
particular frequency, stations whose frequencies are far off
will not excite any response in the circuit. The value of
$R$ has to be small enough so that only one station at a
time is picked up, but big enough so that the tuner isn't
too touchy. The resonant frequency can be tuned by adjusting
either $L$ or $C$, but variable capacitors are easier to
build than variable inductors.
\end{eg}
\begin{eg}{A numerical calculation}
        The phone company sends more than one conversation at a
time over the same wire, which is accomplished by shifting
each voice signal into different range of frequencies during
transmission. The number of signals per wire can be maximized by making
each range of frequencies (known as a bandwidth) as small as
possible. It turns out that only a relatively narrow range
of frequencies is necessary in order to make a human voice
intelligible, so the phone company filters out all the
extreme highs and lows. (This is why your phone voice sounds
different from your normal voice.)

\egquestion
If the filter consists of an LRC circuit with a
broad resonance centered around 1.0 kHz, and the capacitor
is 1 $\mu\zu{F}$ (microfarad), what inductance value must be used?

\eganswer
Solving for $L$, we have
\begin{align*}
                         L         &=   \frac{1}{ C\omega^2}   \\
                                 &=    \frac{1}{(10^{-6}\ \zu{F})(2\pi\times10^3\ \zu{s}^{-1})^2}   \\
                                 &=     2.5\times10^{-3}\ \zu{F}^{-1}\zu{s}^2  
\end{align*}
Checking that these really are the same units as henries is
a little tedious, but it builds character:
\begin{align*}
                        \zu{F}^{-1}\zu{s}^2         &=    (\zu{C}^2/\zu{J})^{-1}\zu{s}^2          \\
                                 &=    \zu{J}\cdot\zu{C}^{-2}\zu{s}^2          \\
                                 &=    \zu{J}/\zu{A}^2  \\
                                 &=    \zu{H}          
\end{align*}
The result is 25 mH (millihenries).
(An inductance value this large would probably be imlemented with an op-amp, not a coil.)

 % 
What is physically happening in one of these oscillating
circuits? Let's first look at the mechanical case, and then
draw the analogy to the circuit. For simplicity, let's
ignore the existence of damping, so there is no friction in
the mechanical oscillator, and no resistance in the electrical one.

Suppose we take the mechanical oscillator and pull the mass
away from equilibrium, then release it. Since friction tends
to resist the spring's force, we might naively expect that
having zero friction would allow the mass to leap instantaneously
to the equilibrium position. This can't happen, however,
because the mass would have to have infinite velocity in
order to make such an instantaneous leap. Infinite velocity
would require infinite kinetic energy, but the only kind of
energy that is available for conversion to kinetic is the
 energy stored in the spring, and that is finite,
not infinite. At each step on its way back to equilibrium,
the mass's velocity is controlled exactly by the amount of
the spring's energy that has so far been converted into kinetic energy. After the mass
reaches equilibrium, it overshoots due to its own momentum.
It performs identical oscillations on both sides of
equilibrium, and it never loses amplitude because friction
is not available to convert mechanical energy into heat.

Now with the electrical oscillator, the analog of position
is charge. Pulling the mass away from equilibrium is like
depositing charges $+q$ and $-q$ on the plates of the
capacitor. Since resistance tends to resist the flow of
charge, we might imagine that with no friction present, the
charge would instantly flow through the inductor (which is,
after all, just a piece of wire), and the capacitor would
discharge instantly. However, such an instant discharge is
impossible, because it would require infinite current for
one instant. Infinite current would create infinite magnetic
fields surrounding the inductor, and these fields would have
infinite energy. Instead, the rate of flow of current is
controlled at each instant by the relationship between the
amount of energy stored in the magnetic field and the amount
of current that must exist in order to have that strong a
field. After the capacitor reaches $q=0$, it overshoots. The
circuit has its own kind of electrical ``inertia,'' because
if charge was to stop flowing, there would have to be zero
current through the inductor. But the current in the
inductor must be related to the amount of energy stored in
its magnetic fields. When the capacitor is at $q=0$, all the
circuit's energy is in the inductor, so it must therefore
have strong magnetic fields surrounding it and quite a bit
of current going through it.

The only thing that might seem spooky here is that we used
to speak as if the current in the inductor caused the
magnetic field, but now it sounds as if the field causes the
current. Actually this is symptomatic of the elusive nature
of cause and effect in physics. It's equally valid to think
of the cause and effect relationship in either way. This may
seem unsatisfying, however, and for example does not really
get at the question of what brings about a voltage
difference across the resistor (in the case where the
resistance is finite); there must be such a voltage
difference, because without one, Ohm's law would predict
zero current through the resistor.

Voltage, then, is what is really missing from our story so far.

Let's start by studying the voltage across a capacitor.
Voltage is electrical potential energy per unit charge, so
the voltage difference between the two plates of the
capacitor is related to the amount by which its energy would
increase if we increased the absolute values of the charges on the plates
 from $q$ to $q+\der q$:
\begin{align*}
                V_C         &=    (U_{q+\der q}-U_q)/\der q   \\
                        &=        \frac{\der U_C}{\der q} \\
                        &= \frac{\der}{\der q}\left(\frac{1}{2C}q^2\right) \\
                        &= \frac{q}{C} 
\end{align*}
Many books
use this as the definition of capacitance. This equation, by
the way, probably explains the historical reason why $C$ was
defined so that the energy was \emph{inversely} proportional
to $C$ for a given value of $q$: the people who invented the
definition were thinking of a capacitor as a device for
storing charge rather than energy, and the amount of charge
stored for a fixed voltage (the charge ``capacity'') is
proportional to $C$.

    %q{The inductor releases energy and gives it to the black box.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

In the case of an inductor, we know that if there is a
steady, constant current flowing through it, then the
magnetic field is constant, and so is the amount of energy
stored; no energy is being exchanged between the inductor and
any other circuit element. But what if the current is changing? The magnetic
field is proportional to the current, so a change in one
implies a change in the other. For concreteness, let's
imagine that the magnetic field and the current are both
decreasing. The energy stored in the magnetic field is
therefore decreasing, and by conservation of energy, this
energy can't just go away --- some other circuit element must
be taking energy from the inductor. The simplest example,
shown in figure \figref{indv}, is a series circuit consisting
of the inductor plus one other circuit element. It doesn't matter
what this other circuit element is, so we just call it a black box,
but if you like, we can think of it as a resistor, in which case
the energy lost by the inductor is being turned into heat by
the resistor. 
The junction rule tells us that both circuit
elements have the same current through them, so $I$ could refer
to either one.

Experience with the loop rule would also lead us to expect that
$V_{inductor}+V_{black\ box}=0$, so the two voltage drops
have the same absolute value, which we could then notate simply as $V$.
In real-world circuits, this is indeed what we would usually find, to a good
approximation, using an AC voltmeter, although the loop rule can actually
be violated in an AC circuit (\note{ac-circuit-loop-rule}).

Whatever the black box is, the rate at which it
is taking energy from the inductor is given by $P=IV$, so (ignoring signs)
\begin{align*}
        IV &= \frac{\der U_L}{\der t} \\
                &= \frac{\der}{\der t}\left( \frac{1}{2}LI^2\right)  \\
                &= LI\frac{\der I}{\der t}\eqquad,\\
\intertext{or}
        V        &= L\frac{\der I}{\der t}, \qquad \text{[See below re sign.]}
\end{align*}
which in many books is taken to be the definition of inductance. When applying
this in a circuit, we insert a sign in front that 
indicates that the inductor resists the change in current, i.e., that provides
negative feedback. The choice of
sign that accomplishes this is partly a matter of arbitrary choice, since
the real-world measurements that ultimately define $V$ and $I$ depend on how we
hook up the voltmeter and ammeter.

To someone who knew only about DC circuits, $V=L\der I/\der t$ would be a surprising result. Suppose, for
concreteness, that the black box in figure \figref{indv} is a resistor,
and that the inductor's energy is decreasing, and being converted into heat
in the resistor. The voltage drop across the resistor indicates that
it has an electric field across it, which is driving the current.
But where is this electric field coming from? There are no charges anywhere
that could be creating it! The answer, of course, is that this is an example
of electromagnetic induction.
One of Maxwell's equations (sec.~\ref{sec:maxwell-vacuum}, p.~\pageref{sec:maxwell-vacuum})
is that $\operatorname{curl}\vc{E}=-\partial\vc{B}/\partial t$, which tells us
that the change in the magnetic field will cause a curly electric field,
If we hadn't already known about induction, this example would have forced us
to invent it.

The cartoons in figure \figref{inductor-voltage} compares electric fields made by charges, 1,
to electric fields made by changing magnetic fields, 2-3. In \figref{inductor-voltage}/1, two
physicists are in a room whose ceiling is positively charged and whose floor is negatively
charged. The physicist on the bottom throws a positively charged bowling ball into the curved
pipe. The physicist at the top uses a radar gun to measure the speed of the ball as it comes
out of the pipe. They find that the ball has slowed down by the time it gets to the top. By measuring the change in the
ball's kinetic energy, the two physicists are acting just like a voltmeter. They conclude that the
top of the tube is at a higher voltage than the bottom of the pipe. A difference in voltage
indicates an electric field, and this field is clearly being caused by the charges in the
floor and ceiling.

In \figref{inductor-voltage}/2, there are no charges anywhere in the room except for the
charged bowling ball. Moving charges make magnetic fields, so there is a magnetic field
surrounding the helical pipe while the ball is moving through it. A magnetic field has been
created where there was none before, and that field has energy. Where could the energy have
come from? It can only have come from the ball itself, so the ball must be losing kinetic energy.
The two physicists working together are again acting as a voltmeter, and again they conclude
that there is a voltage difference between the top and bottom of the pipe. This indicates
an electric field, but this electric field can't have been created by any charges, because
there aren't any in the room. This electric field was created by the change in the magnetic field.

The bottom physicist keeps on throwing balls into the pipe, until the pipe is full of balls,
\figref{inductor-voltage}/3, and finally a steady current is established.
While the pipe was filling up with balls, the energy in the
magnetic field was steadily increasing, and that energy was being stolen from the
balls' kinetic energy. But once a steady current is established, the energy in the magnetic
field is no longer changing. The balls no longer have to give up energy in order to
build up the field, and the physicist at the top finds that the balls are exiting the
pipe at full speed again. There is no voltage difference any more. Although there is
a current, $\der I/\der t$ is zero.

\begin{eg}{Ballasts}\label{eg:ballast}\index{ballast}\index{gas discharge tube}\index{fluorescent light}
In a gas discharge tube, such as
a neon sign, enough voltage is applied to a tube full of gas to ionize some of the atoms
in the gas. Once ions have been created, the voltage accelerates them, and they
strike other atoms, ionizing them as well and resulting in a chain reaction. This is a spark,
like a bolt of lightning. But once the spark starts up,
the device begins to act as though it has no resistance: more and more current flows, without
the need to apply any more voltage. The power, $P=IV$, would grow without limit, and the tube 
would burn itself out.

The simplest solution is to connect an inductor, known as the ``ballast,'' in series with the
tube, and run the whole thing on an AC voltage. During each cycle, as the voltage reaches the
point where the chain reaction begins, there is a surge of current, but the inductor resists
such a sudden change of current, and the energy that would otherwise have burned out the bulb
is instead channeled into building a magnetic field.

A common household fluorescent lightbulb consists of a gas discharge tube in which the 
glass is coated with a fluorescent material. The gas in the tube emits ultraviolet light,
which is absorbed by the coating, and the coating then glows in the visible spectrum.

Until recently, it was common for a fluroescent light's ballast to be a simple inductor,
and for the whole device to be operated at the 60 Hz frequency of the electrical power lines. This caused
the lights to flicker annoyingly at 120 Hz, and could also cause an audible hum, since
the magnetic field surrounding the inductor could exert mechanical forces on things.
Modern compact fluorescent bulbs have ballasts built into their bases that use
a frequency in the kilohertz range, eliminating the flicker and
hum.

In section \ref{sec:lrc-oscillations} we analyzed the oscillations of a series LRC circuit
simply by appealing to the mechanical analog, which we had already solved, but it's
also interesting to write down the actual differential equation for the circuit.
The loop rule is approximately valid under the lumped circuit approximation, so
\begin{equation*}
  V_L+V_R+V_C = 0.
\end{equation*}
We now want to express this in terms of $q$ and its derivatives, so we use
$V_C=q/C$, $V_R=IR=Rq'$, and $|V_L|=L\der I/\der t=Lq''$, resulting in
\begin{equation*}
  Lq''+Rq'+\frac{1}{C}q = 0.
\end{equation*}
If we look for solutions of the form $q=e^{st}$, we find that $Ls^2+Rs+1/C=0$.\label{lrc-roots}
When $R=0$, the solutions are $s=\pm i/\sqrt{LC}$, or $\omega=\mp\sqrt{LC}$, as expected.

The wire passes in through one side of the cube and out through the other. If the current through the wire is
increasing, then the wire will act like an inductor, and there will be a voltage difference between its ends.
(The inductance will be relatively small, since the wire isn't coiled up, and the $\Delta V$ will therefore
also be fairly small, but still not zero.) The $\Delta V$ implies the
existence of electric fields, and yet Gauss's law says the flux must be zero, since there is no charge inside
the cube. Why isn't Gauss's law violated?
\end{dq}

\begin{dq}\label{dq:gauss-examples-induction2}
The charge has been loitering near the edge of the cube, but is then suddenly hit with a mallet, causing it to
fly off toward the left side of the cube. We haven't yet discussed in detail how disturbances in the electric and magnetic fields
ripple outward through space, but it turns out that they do so at the speed of light. (In fact, that's what light
is: ripples in the electric and magnetic fields.) Because the charge is closer to the left side of the cube,
the change in the electric field occurs there before the information reaches the right side. 
This would seem certain to lead to a violation of Gauss's law. How can the ideas explored in
discussion question \ref{dq:gauss-examples-induction1} show the resolution to this paradox?

Up until now I've soft-pedaled the fact that by changing the
characteristics of an oscillator, it is possible to produce
non-oscillatory behavior. For example, imagine taking the
mass-on-a-spring system and making the spring weaker and
weaker. In the limit of small $k$, it's as though there was
no spring whatsoever, and the behavior of the system is that
if you kick the mass, it simply starts slowing down. Although the
limit $k\rightarrow0$ is intuitively easy to imagine in the
mechanical case, we get the non-oscillatory behavior
whenever $Q<1/2$ (\note{overdamped-q}).
In sections \ref{subsec:rc} and \ref{subsec:rl} we will analyze only the
cases where either the
capacitor or the inductor is completely absent, giving $Q=0$.

<% begin_sec("The RC circuit",nil,'rc') %>
\index{RC circuit}
We first analyze the RC circuit, \figref{rc}. In reality one would
have to ``kick'' the circuit, for example by briefly
inserting a battery, in order to get any interesting
behavior. Setting $L=0$ in our analysis from p.~\pageref{lrc-roots}, we have
\begin{equation*}
                        I         =      -\frac{1}{RC}q
\end{equation*}
The negative sign tells us that the current tends to reduce
the charge on the capacitor, i.e., to discharge it. It makes
sense that the current is proportional to $q$\/:  if $q$ is
large, then the attractive forces between the $+q$ and $-q$
charges on the plates of the capacitor are large, and
charges will flow more quickly through the resistor in order
to reunite. If there was zero charge on the capacitor
plates, there would be no reason for current to flow. Since
amperes, the unit of current, are the same as coulombs per
second, it appears that the quantity $RC$ must have
units of seconds, and you can check for yourself that this
is correct. $RC$ is therefore referred to as the time
constant of the circuit.\index{RC time constant}\index{time constant!RC}

How exactly do $I$ and $q$ vary with time? Rewriting $I$ as
$\der q/\der t$, we have
\begin{equation*}
                \frac{\der q}{\der t} = -\frac{1}{RC}q\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
We need a function $q(t)$ whose derivative
equals itself, but multiplied by a negative constant.
A function of the form $ae^t$, where $e=2.718...$ is the base of natural logarithms,
is the only one that has its derivative equal to itself, and
$ae^{bt}$ has its derivative equal to itself multiplied by $b$. Thus
our solution is
\begin{equation*}
                q = q_\zu{o}\exp\left(-\frac{t}{RC}\right)\eqquad.

The RL circuit, \figref{rl}, can be attacked by similar methods, and

The RL time constant equals $L/R$.

\begin{eg}{Death by solenoid; spark plugs}\index{spark plug}
When we suddenly break an RL circuit, what will happen?
It might seem that we're faced with a paradox, since we only
have two forms of energy, magnetic energy and heat, and if the
current stops suddenly, the magnetic field must collapse suddenly.
But where does the lost magnetic energy go? It can't go into
resistive heating of the resistor, because the circuit has now
been broken, and current can't flow!

The way out of this conundrum is to recognize that the open gap
in the circuit has a resistance which is large, but not infinite.
This large resistance causes the RL time constant $L/ R$ to be very
small. The current thus continues to flow for a very brief time, and
flows straight across the air gap where the circuit has been opened.
In other words, there is a spark!

We can determine based on several different lines of
reasoning that the voltage drop from one end of the spark to the other must be
very large. First, the air's resistance is large, so $V= IR$ requires a large
voltage. We can also reason that all the energy in the magnetic field is
being dissipated in a short time, so the power dissipated in the spark, $P= IV$,
is large, and this requires a large value of $V$. ($I$ isn't large --- it is
decreasing from its initial value.) Yet a third way to reach the same result
is to consider the equation $V_{L}=\der I/\der t$\/: since the time constant
is short, the time derivative $\der I/\der t$ is large.

This is exactly how a car's spark plugs work. Another application is to
electrical safety: it can be dangerous to break an inductive circuit
suddenly, because so much energy is released in a short time. There is
also no guarantee that the spark will discharge across the air gap; it
might go through your body instead, since your body might have a lower
resistance.

Figure \figref{spark-gap-transmitter} shows a primitive type of radio transmitter, called
a spark gap transmitter, used to send Morse code around the turn of the twentieth century. The high voltage
source, V, is typically about 10,000 volts. When the telegraph
switch, S, is closed, the RC
circuit on the left starts charging up. An increasing voltage difference develops between the electrodes of the spark gap, G.
When this voltage difference gets large enough, the electric field in the air between the electrodes
causes a spark, partially discharging the RC circuit, but charging the LC circuit on the right.
The LC circuit then oscillates at its resonant frequency (typically about 1 MHz), but the energy of these oscillations is
rapidly radiated away by the antenna, A, which sends out radio waves.

\notetext{ac-circuit-loop-rule}{The loop rule in an AC circuit}
\notesummary{Why does the loop rule work at all in AC circuits?}

When we take measurements with an AC voltmeter, we find in practice that the
loop rule often holds for AC circuits.
But this is a little bit like
the story of the centipede who is asked how he keeps all his legs coordinated
and replies, ``You know, I never thought about that before,'' after which he
is no longer able to walk. The loop rule is essentially a statement that
the electric field has $\curl\vc{E}=0$, but this is false when we have
induction. One of Maxwell's equations (sec.~\ref{sec:maxwell-vacuum}, p.~\pageref{sec:maxwell-vacuum})
is that $\operatorname{curl}\vc{E}=-\partial\vc{B}/\partial t$, which tells us
that the change in the magnetic field will cause a curly electric field.
There is thus no well-defined electric potential, and the loop rule should
be invalid. So why does it seem to work here when it shouldn't? The answer is that
when the lumped circuit approximation is valid, the external magnetic fields of
circuit elements like inductors are negligible, and therefore it is approximately
true, in the empty space surrounding the circuit where we place our voltmeters, that
$\curl\vc{E}=0$. Because of these issues, many writers will define a symbol
such as $\mathcal{E}$, referred to as ``emf,''\footnote{standing for ``electromotive force,''
a horrifically bad piece of
terminology, since it doesn't even have units of force} which is minus the work done by an electric field between
one point in space and another. This is essentially the same as the definition of
a voltage difference, but without the connotation that there is a well-defined
electric potential.

\notetext{overdamped-q}{Overdamping}
\notesummary{Overdamping occurs for $Q<1/2$.}
As shown on p.~\pageref{lrc-roots}, the solutions to the equation of
motion for a series LRC circuit are of the form $q=e^{st}$, where
$Ls^2+Rs+1/C=0$. The roots of this polynomial equation are given by
the quadratic formula, which contains the square root of the
discriminant $R^2-4L/C$. By analogy with the mechanical case
(p.~\pageref{q-mechanical}), $Q=C^{-1/2}L^{1/2}R^{-1}$,\index{$Q$ (quality factor)!LRC circuit}%
\index{quality factor ($Q$)!LRC circuit}
so the discriminant is positive when $Q<1/2$, which is referred to as
the case of overdamping.

The idea is that according to a set of
related mathematical results called Fourier's theorem and the Fourier inversion theorem, we expect to
be able to write any sufficiently well-behaved function as a sum of sine waves. For periodic functions,
the sum is in general an infinite series. For example, a square wave can be written as
$\eqnimage{eqn-wave1}+\frac{1}{3}\eqnimage{eqn-wave3}+\frac{1}{5}\eqnimage{eqn-wave5}+\ldots$
For nonperiodic functions, the sum will usually have to be an integral, i.e., a continuous sum.
Although the mathematical theorems require the functions to have certain properties, physicists and
engineers normally don't worry about them, or if necessary we generalize the notion of a function
to try to make them work. An example of such a generalization is the Dirac delta function.
