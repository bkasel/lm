The long road leading from the light bulb to the computer
started with one very important step: the introduction of
feedback into electronic circuits. Although the principle of
feedback has been understood and and applied to mechanical
systems for centuries, and to electrical ones since the
early twentieth century, for most of us the word evokes an
image of Jimi Hendrix
intentionally creating earsplitting screeches, or of the
school principal doing the same inadvertently in the
auditorium. In the guitar example, the musician stands in
front of the amp and turns it up so high that the sound
waves coming from the speaker come back to the guitar string
and make it shake harder. This is an example of \emph{positive}
feedback: the harder the string vibrates, the stronger the
sound waves, and the stronger the sound waves, the harder
the string vibrates. The only limit is the power-handling
ability of the amplifier.

Negative feedback is equally important. Your thermostat, for
example, provides negative feedback by kicking the heater
off when the house gets warm enough, and by firing it up
again when it gets too cold. This causes the house's
temperature to oscillate back and forth within a certain
range. Just as out-of-control exponential freak-outs are a
characteristic behavior of positive-feedback systems,
oscillation is typical in cases of negative feedback.

<% begin_sec("Review of complex numbers",nil,'complex-numbers') %>\index{complex numbers}
Positive feedback causes exponential behavior, while negative feedback causes oscillations.
The complex number system makes it possible to describe all of these phenomena in a simple and unified
way.
For a more detailed treatment of complex numbers, see ch.~3 of
James Nearing's free book at \url{physics.miami.edu/~nearing}.

We assume there is a number, $i$, such that $i^2=-1$.
The square roots of $-1$ are then $i$ and $-i$. (In electrical engineering work,
where $i$ stands for current, $j$ is sometimes used instead.) This gives rise
to a number system, called the complex numbers, containing the real numbers as a subset.

If we calculate successive powers of $i$, we get the following:
\begin{align*}
  i^0 &= \quad 1 \qquad \text{[true for any base]} \\
  i^1 &= \quad i \\
  i^2 &= \, -1 \qquad \text{[definition of $i$]} \\
  i^3 &= \, -i \\
  i^4 &= \quad 1.
\end{align*}
By repeatedly multiplying $i$ by itself, we have wrapped around, returning
to 1 after four iterations. If we keep going like this, we'll keep cycling around.
This is how the complex number system models oscillations, which result from
negative feedback.

To model exponential behavior in the complex number system, we also use repeated
multiplication. For example, if interest payments on your credit card debt cause
it to double every decade (a positive feedback cycle), then your debt goes like
$2^0=1$, $2^1=2$, $2^2=4$, and so on.

Any complex number $z$ can be written in the form $z=a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are
real, and $a$ and $b$ are then referred to as the real and imaginary parts of $z$.
A number with a zero real part is called an imaginary number.
The complex numbers can be visualized as a plane, with the real number line placed
horizontally like the $x$ axis of the familiar $x-y$ plane, and the imaginary numbers running
along the $y$ axis. The complex numbers are complete in a way that the real numbers
aren't: every nonzero complex number has two square roots. For example, 1 is
a real number, so it is also a member of the complex numbers, and its square roots
are $-1$ and 1. Likewise, $-1$ has square roots $i$ and $-i$, and the number $i$
has square roots $1/\sqrt{2}+i/\sqrt{2}$ and $-1/\sqrt{2}-i/\sqrt{2}$.

Complex numbers can be added and subtracted by adding or subtracting their real
and imaginary parts. Geometrically, this is the same as vector addition.

<% end_marg %>

The complex numbers $a+bi$ and $a-bi$, lying at equal distances above and below the
real axis, are called complex conjugates. The results of the quadratic formula
are either both real, or complex conjugates of each other.
The complex conjugate of a number $z$ is notated as $\bar{z}$ or
$z^*$.

The complex numbers obey all the same rules of arithmetic as the reals, except that
they can't be ordered along a single line. That is, it's not possible to say whether
one complex number is greater than another. We can compare them in terms of their
magnitudes (their distances from the origin), but two distinct complex numbers may
have the same magnitude, so, for example, we can't say whether $1$ is greater than
$i$ or $i$ is greater than $1$.

\pagebreak

\begin{eg}{A square root of $i$}\label{eg:sqrt-i}
\egquestion Prove that $1/\sqrt{2}+i/\sqrt{2}$ is a square root of $i$.

\eganswer Our proof can use any ordinary rules of arithmetic, except for
ordering.
\begin{align*}
   (\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}})^2 
    & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
       +\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\cdot\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}
       +\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
       +\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}\cdot\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} \\
    &= \frac{1}{2}(1+i+i-1) \\
    &= i
\end{align*}
\end{eg}

Example \ref{eg:sqrt-i} showed one method of multiplying complex numbers.
However, there is another nice interpretation of complex multiplication.
We define the argument of a complex number as its angle in the complex plane, measured
counterclockwise from the positive real axis.
Multiplying two complex numbers then corresponds to multiplying their magnitudes,
and adding their arguments.

Using this interpretation of multiplication, how could you find the
square roots of a complex number?

\begin{eg}{An identity} 
The magnitude $|z|$ of a complex number $z$ obeys
the identity $|z|^2=z\bar{z}$. To prove this, we first note that $\bar{z}$
has the same magnitude as $z$, since flipping it to the other side of the
real axis doesn't change its distance from the origin. Multiplying $z$ by
$\bar{z}$ gives a result whose magnitude is found by multiplying their
magnitudes, so the magnitude of
$z\bar{z}$ must therefore equal  $|z|^2$. Now we just have to prove that
$z\bar{z}$ is a positive real number. But if, for example, $z$ lies counterclockwise
from the real axis, then $\bar{z}$ lies clockwise from it. If $z$ has a positive
argument, then $\bar{z}$ has a negative one, or vice-versa. The sum of their arguments is therefore
zero, so the result has an argument of zero, and is on the positive real axis.
\footnote{I cheated a little. If $z$'s argument
is 30 degrees, then we could say $\bar{z}$'s was -30, but we could also call it
330. That's OK, because 330+30 gives 360, and an argument of
360 is the same as an argument of zero.}

This whole system was built up in order to make every number have square roots.
What about cube roots, fourth roots, and so on? Does it get even more weird when
you want to do those as well? No. The complex number system we've already discussed
is sufficient to handle all of them. The nicest way of thinking about it is in terms
of roots of polynomials. In the real number system, the polynomial $x^2-1$ has
two roots, i.e., two values of $x$ (plus and minus one) that we can plug in to the
polynomial and get zero. Because it has these two real roots, we can rewrite the
polynomial as $(x-1)(x+1)$. However, the polynomial $x^2+1$ has no real roots. It's
ugly that in the real number system, some second-order polynomials have two
roots, and can be factored, while others can't. In the complex number system,
they all can. For instance, $x^2+1$ has roots $i$ and $-i$, and can be factored
as $(x-i)(x+i)$. In general, the fundamental theorem of algebra\index{fundamental theorem of algebra}
states that in the complex number system,
any nth-order polynomial can be factored completely
into $n$ linear factors, and we can also say that it has $n$ complex roots,
with the understanding that some of the roots may be the same. For instance,
the fourth-order polynomial $x^4+x^2$ can be factored as $(x-i)(x+i)(x-0)(x-0)$,
and we say that it has four roots, $i$, $-i$, 0, and 0, two of which happen to be
the same. This is a sensible way to think about it, because in real life, numbers are
always approximations anyway, and if we make tiny, random changes
to the coefficients of this polynomial,
it will have four distinct roots, of which two just happen to be very close
to zero.

\index{Euler's formula}\index{Euler, Leonhard}
Having expanded our horizons to include the complex numbers, it's natural to want to extend
functions we knew and loved from the world of real numbers so that they can also operate on
complex numbers. The only really natural way to do this in general is to use Taylor series.
A particularly beautiful thing happens with the functions $e^x$, $\sin x$, and $\cos x$:
\begin{align*}
  e^x    &= 1 + \frac{1}{2!}x^2 + \frac{1}{3!}x^3 + \ldots \\
  \cos x &= 1 - \frac{1}{2!}x^2 + \frac{1}{4!}x^4 - \ldots \\
  \sin x &= x - \frac{1}{3!}x^3 + \frac{1}{5!}x^5 - \ldots 
\end{align*}
If $x=i\phi$ is an imaginary number, we have
\begin{equation*}
  e^{i\phi} = \cos \phi + i \sin \phi\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
a result known as Euler's formula.\index{Euler's formula}
The geometrical interpretation in the complex
plane is shown in figure \figref{euler}.

Although the result may seem like something out of a freak show at first,
applying the definition of the exponential function
makes it clear how natural it is:
\begin{align*}
  e^x = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \left(1+\frac{x}{n}\right)^n\eqquad.
\end{align*}
When $x=i\phi$ is imaginary, the quantity $(1+i\phi/n)$ represents a number
lying just above 1 in the complex plane. For large $n$, $(1+i\phi/n)$
becomes very close to the unit circle, and its argument is the small
angle $\phi/n$. Raising this number to the nth power multiplies its
argument by $n$, giving a number with an argument of $\phi$.

Euler's formula is used frequently in physics and engineering.

\begin{eg}{Trig functions in terms of complex exponentials}
\egquestion Write the sine and cosine functions in terms of exponentials.

\eganswer Euler's formula for $x=-i\phi$ gives $\cos \phi - i \sin \phi$,
since $\cos(-\theta)=\cos\theta$, and $\sin(-\theta)=-\sin\theta$.
\begin{align*}
  \cos x &= \frac{e^{ix}+e^{-ix}}{2} \\
  \sin x &= \frac{e^{ix}-e^{-ix}}{2i} 
\end{align*}
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{A hard integral made easy}
\egquestion Evaluate
\begin{equation*}
  \int e^x \cos x \der x
\end{equation*}

\eganswer This seemingly impossible integral becomes easy if we rewrite
the cosine in terms of exponentials:
\begin{align*}
  \int e^x & \cos x \der x \\
      &= \int e^x \left(\frac{e^{ix}+e^{-ix}}{2}\right) \der x \\
      &= \frac{1}{2} \int (e^{(1+i)x}+e^{(1-i)x})\der x \\
      &= \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{e^{(1+i)x}}{1+i}+\frac{e^{(1-i)x}}{1-i} \right)+ c
\end{align*}

Since this result is the integral of a real-valued function, we'd like it to be
real, and in fact it is, since the first and second terms are complex conjugates of
one another. If we wanted to, we could use Euler's theorem to convert it back to
a manifestly real result.\footnote{In general, the use of complex number techniques to
do an integral could result in a complex number, but that complex number would
be a constant, which could be subsumed within the usual constant of integration.}

<% begin_sec("Simple harmonic motion",nil,'shm') %>\index{simple harmonic motion}
The simple harmonic oscillator should already be familiar to you. Here we show how
complex numbers apply to the topic.

Figure \subfigref{mass-on-spring}{1} shows a mass vibrating on a
spring. If there is no friction, then the mass vibrates forever, and
energy is transferred repeatedly back and forth between kinetic energy
in the mass and potential energy in the spring. If we add friction,
then the oscillations will dissipate these forms of energy into heat
over time.  Figure \subfigref{mass-on-spring}{2} is the electrical
analog of the mass on the spring.  Energy cycles back and forth
between electrical energy in the field between the capacitor plates
and magnetic energy in the field of the coil of wire, which in this
context is referred to as an inductor. The electrical analog of
friction is the resistance, which dissipates the energy of the
oscillations into heat.

<%
  fig(
    'mass-on-spring',
    %q{1.~A mass vibrating on a spring. 2.~A circuit displaying analogous electrical oscillations.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

The dissipation of energy into heat is referred to as damping.
This section covers simple harmonic motion, which is the case without
damping. We consider the more general damped case in sec.~\ref{sec:damping}.


The system of analogous variables is as follows:

\begin{tabular}{lp{50mm}p{70mm}}
\emph{mechanical} & \emph{electrical} \\
$x=\text{position}$ & $q=\text{charge on one plate}$ \\
$v=x'=\text{velocity}$ & $I=q'=\text{current}$ \\
$a=x''=\text{acceleration}$ & $I'=\text{rate of change of current}$ 
\end{tabular}

Since this system of analogies is perfect, we'll discuss the behavior
of the more familiar mechanical system. The mass is acted on by a force
$-kx$ from the spring.
Newton's second law can be written as
\begin{equation*}
  mx''+kx = 0.
\end{equation*}
An equation like this, which relates a function to its own derivatives, is
called a \emph{differential equation}. This one is a \emph{linear} differential
equation, meaning that if $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ are both solutions, then
so is any linear combination of them, $c_1x_1(t)+c_2x_2(t)$.
It's not hard to guess what the solutions are: sines and cosines
work as solutions, because the sine and cosine are functions whose second derivative
is the same as the original function, except for a sign flip. The most general
solution is of the form
\begin{equation*}
  c_1\sin\omega t+c_2\cos\omega t,
\end{equation*}
where the frequency\footnote{We
use the word ``frequency'' to mean either $f$ or $\omega=2\pi f$
when the context makes it clear which is being referred to.} is $\omega=\sqrt{k/m}$.
It makes sense that there are two adjustable constants, because if we're given some
the initial position and velocity of the mass, those are two numbers that we want
to produce, and typically two equations in two unknowns will have a solution. Mathematically,
this happens because the highest derivative in the differential equation is a second derivative.

But we would like to have some more specific and convenient way of organizing our thoughts
about the physical interpretation of the constants $c_1$ and $c_2$. Suppose we write down
some examples of solutions on scraps of papers and then put them on a table and shuffle them
around to try to see them in an organized way. As a loose analogy, this was how Mendeleev
came up with the periodic table of the elements. Figure \figref{sine-wave-paper-scraps}
shows what we might come up with for our ``periodic table of the sine waves.'' What we've
created is a system in which the solution $c_1\sin+c_2\cos$ is represented as a square on
a checkerboard or, more generally, a point in the plane. Beautiful things happen if we
think of this plane as being the complex plane, as laid out in the following table
of exact mathematical analogies.

Differentiating a second time gives $(\sin 3x)''=-9\sin 3x$.
In terms of complex numbers, this is $1(3i)(3i)=-9$.

If we apply this system of analogies the the equation of motion $mx''+kx = 0$, for a solution
with amplitude $A$, we get $(-m\omega^2+k)A=0$, and if $A$ is nonzero, this means that
\begin{equation*}
  -m\omega^2+k=0.
\end{equation*}
This is a big win, because now instead of solving a differential equation, we just have to
analyze an equation using algebra. If $A$ is nonzero, then the factor in parentheses has to be
zero, and that gives $\omega=\sqrt{k/m}$. (We could use the negative square root, but that doesn't
actually give different solutions.)\label{end-sec-shm}
<% end_sec('shm') %>

<% begin_sec("Damped oscillations",nil,'damping') %>
We now extend the discussion to include damping.  If you haven't
learned about damped oscillations before, you may want to look first
at a treatment that doesn't use complex numbers, such as the one in
ch.~15 of OpenStax University Physics, volume 1, which is free online. 

In the mechanical case, we will assume for mathematical convenience
that the frictional force is proportional to velocity. Although this
is not realistic for the friction of a solid rubbing against a solid,
it is a reasonable approximation for some forms of friction, and 
anyhow it has the advantage of making the mechanical and electrical
systems in figure \figref{mass-on-spring} exactly analogous
mathematically.

With this assumption, we add in to Newton's second law
a frictional force $-bv$, where $b$ is a constant. The equation of motion
is now
\begin{equation*}
  mx''+bx'+kx = 0.
\end{equation*}
Applying the trick with the complex-number analogy, this becomes
$-m\omega^2+i\omega b+k=0$, which says that $\omega$ is a root of a polynomial.
Since we're used to dealing with polynomials that have real coefficients,
it's helpful to switch to the variable $s=i\omega$, which means that we're
looking for solutions of the form $Ae^{st}$. In terms of this variable,
\begin{equation*}
  ms^2+bs+k=0.
\end{equation*}
The most common case is one where $b$ is fairly small, so that the
quadratic formula produces two solutions for $r$ that are complex
conjugates of each other. As a simple example without units, let's say
that these two roots are $s_1=-1+i$ and $s_2=-1-i$. Then if $A=1$, our
solution corresponding to $s_1$ is $x_1=e^{(-1+i)t}=e^{-t}e^{it}$.
The $e^{it}$ factor spins in the complex plane, representing an oscillation,
while the $e^{-t}$ makes it die out exponentially due to
friction.  In reality, our solution should be a real number, and if we
like, we can make this happen by adding up combinations, e.g.,
$x_1+x_2=2e^{-t}\cos t$, but it's usually easier just to write down
the $x_1$ solution and interpret it as a decaying oscillation. Figure
\figref{sc-strongly-damped} shows an example.

<% end_sec('damping') %>

<% begin_sec("Resonance",nil,'resonance') %>\index{resonance}
When a sinusoidally oscillating external driving force is applied to
our system, it will respond by settling into a pattern of vibration in
which it oscillates at the driving frequency. A mother pushing her kid
on a playground swing is a mechanical example (not quite a rigorous
one, since her force as a function of time is not a sine wave).  An
electrical example is a radio receiver driven by a signal picked up
from the antenna. In both of these examples, it matters whether we
pick the right driving force.  In the example of the playground swing,
Mom needs to push in rhythm with the swing's pendulum frequency. In
the radio receiver, we tune in a specific frequency and reject others.
These are examples of resonance: the system responds most strongly to
driving at its natural frequency of oscillation. If you haven't had
a previous introduction to resonance in the mechanical context, this
review will not be adequate, and you will first want to look at another book,
such as OpenStax University Physics.

With the addition of a driving force $F$, the equation of motion for the
damped oscillator becomes
\begin{equation*}
  mx''+bx'+kx = F,
\end{equation*}
where $F$ is a function of time. In terms of complex amplitudes, this is
$(-\omega^2m+i\omega b+k)A=\mytilde{F}$. Here we introduce the notation $\mytilde{F}$, which
looks like a little sine wave above the $F$, to mean the complex number representing $F$'s
amplitude. The result for the steady-state response of the oscillator is
\begin{equation*}
  A = \frac{\mytilde{F}}{-\omega^2m+i\omega b+k}.
\end{equation*}
To see that this makes sense, consider the case where $b=0$. Then by setting $\omega$
equal to the natural frequency $\sqrt{k/m}$ we can make $A$ blow up to infinity. This
is exactly what would happen if Mom pushed Baby on the swing and there was no friction
to keep the oscillations from building up indefinitely.

The peak in the graph of $|A|$ demonstrates that there is a resonance. Increasing $Q$,
i.e., decreasing damping, makes the response at resonance greater, which is intuitively
reasonable. What is a little more surprising is that it also changes the \emph{shape}
of the resonance peak, making it narrower and spikier. The width of the resonance peak
is often described using the full width at half-maximum, or FWHM, defined in figure
\figref{fwhm}. The FWHM is approximately equal to $1/Q$ times the resonant frequency,
the approximation being a good one when $Q$ is large.\index{$Q$ (quality factor)}\index{FWHM (full width at half maximum)}
