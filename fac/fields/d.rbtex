At this stage, you understand roughly as much about the classification
of interactions as physicists understood around the year 1800. There
appear to be three fundamentally different types of interactions:
gravitational, electrical, and magnetic. Many types of interactions
that appear superficially to be distinct --- stickiness, chemical
interactions, the energy an archer stores in a bow --- are really the
same: they're manifestations of electrical interactions between atoms.
Is there any way to shorten the list any further? The prospects seem
dim at first. For instance, we find that if we rub a piece of fur on a
rubber rod, the fur does not attract or repel a magnet.  The fur has
an electric field, and the magnet has a magnetic field. The two are
completely separate, and don't seem to affect one another. Likewise we
can test whether magnetizing a piece of iron changes its weight. The
weight doesn't seem to change by any measurable amount, so magnetism
and gravity seem to be unrelated. 

That was where things stood until 1820, when the Danish physicist Hans
Christian\index{Oersted, Hans Christian} Oersted was delivering a
lecture at the University of Copenhagen, and he wanted to give his
students a demonstration that would illustrate the cutting edge of
research. He used a battery to make charge flow through a wire, and
held the wire near a magnetic compass. The ideas was to give an
example of how one could search for a previously undiscovered link
between electricity (the charge flowing in the wire) and magnetism.
One never knows how much to believe from these dramatic legends, but
the story is that the experiment he'd expected to turn out negative
instead turned out positive: when he held the wire near the compass,
the charge flowing through the wire caused the compass to twist!

Oersted was led to the conclusion that when matter creates magnetic
fields, it happens because the matter contains moving charges.  A
permanent magnet, he inferred, contained moving charges on a microscopic
scale, but their motion simply wasn't practical to detect using
human-scale measuring devices in the lab. Today
this seems natural to us based on the planetary model of the atom. As
shown in figure \figref{magnetized}, a magnetized piece of iron is
different from an unmagnetized piece because the atoms in the
unmagnetized piece are jumbled in random orientations, whereas the
atoms in the magnetized piece are at least partially organized to face
in a certain direction.

Not until later in this book will we get into the mathematical
and geometrical details of the magnetic fields created by moving charges.
However, we can immediately make some far-reaching conclusions. Figure
\subfigref{field-transformation-cartoon}{1} shows, in a cartoonish way,
the fact that a line of positive charges, at rest, makes an electric field
in the surrounding space. If we approximate the charges as a continuous line
with no gaps, then the electric field is one we have already studied in sec.~\ref{sec:gauss-in-lt-3-dim},
p.~\pageref{sec:gauss-in-lt-3-dim}: it points outward, and its magnitude is
proportional to $1/r$, where $r$ is the distance from the line.

But now let's switch to a different frame of reference, as in figure
\subfigref{field-transformation-cartoon}{2}. In this frame, the charges are moving,
so there is both an electric field and a magnetic field. We are led to the following
important conclusion:

\begin{important}[Electromagnetism]
A certain mixture of electric and magnetic fields will be measured as a different
mixture by an observer in a different state of motion.
\end{important}

This shows that electric and magnetic fields are not entirely separate things, but
are instead two sides of the same coin. The conclusion holds regardless of whether
matter is present. For these reasons, the entire subject of electricity and magnetism is
often referred to by the term electromagnetism. We often refer loosely to ``the electromagnetic
field,'' meaning both $\vc{E}$ and $\vc{B}$ collectively.

In the language of section \ref{subsec:charge-invariant}, p.~\pageref{subsec:charge-invariant}, the fields
are not invariant quantities. They depend on the frame of reference,
as do other more familiar quantities such as velocity. When we want to
convert a velocity vector from one frame of reference to another, we
have a rule for doing so, which is simple vector addition. In fancy
language, this is called ``transforming'' the velocity vector. The
rules for transforming electric and magnetic fields are more
complicated, and we will postpone discussing them until sec.~\ref{sec:einstein-motorcycle2},
p.~\pageref{sec:einstein-motorcycle2}. However,
one thing we can say about the transformations is that they must be
\emph{additive}, because the laws of physics obey the principle of
superposition, and we want the laws of physics to be equally valid in
all frames of reference.

By the way, the concepts that we are describing using the words ``superposition''
and ``additive'' are usually referred to by mathematicians using the terms
``linearity'' and ``linear.'' For example, a mathematician would describe
the derivative rule $(f+g)'=f'+g'$ from freshman calculus as the linearity
of the derivative.

\begin{eg}{Throwing salt doesn't make a magnet}\label{eg:salt-crystal}
Figure \figref{salt-crystal} shows a salt crystal. The smaller, darker
spheres are sodium atoms.  Bigger, lighter ones are chlorine. When
these disparate atoms assemble themselves into a solid, some charge
is transferred from the chlorines to the sodiums. This is essentially
the same thing that is going on in static electricity examples such as
the sticky tape in figure \figref{twotapes-fields}, p.~\pageref{fig:twotapes-fields}:
different substances ``like electrons'' to different extents, so when they are
put in contact, one steals from the other.

In the frame of reference where the crystal is at rest, it has an outward electric
field $\vc{E}_1$ due to the sodiums and an inward field $\vc{E}_2$ from the chlorines.
These two fields are theoretically incredibly intense, but due to superposition,
they almost exactly cancel at the macroscopic scale, and cannot be detected outside
the crystal. (At the microscopic scale, where it is evident that the positive and
negative charge distributions aren't exactly the same, the cancellation fails, and
there are intense fields. These fields are what hold the crystal together.)

If we throw the salt crystal, then the field $\vc{E}_1$ of the sodiums
transforms to some mixture of an electric field plus a magnetic field
$\vc{B}_1$, and similarly we have a $\vc{B}_2$ from the chlorines. 
But because $\vc{E}_1+\vc{E}_2=0$, and because the transformation is
additive, we have $\vc{B}_1+\vc{B}_2=0$ as well, and no observable magnetic
field is produced.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Magnetic field of a wire}\label{eg:field-of-wire}
Since the electric field in
\subfigref{field-transformation-cartoon}{1} is proportional to $1/r$ (sec.~\ref{sec:gauss-in-lt-3-dim}
and example \ref{eg:e-line-of-charge}, p.~\pageref{eg:e-line-of-charge}), the electric
and magnetic fields in \subfigref{field-transformation-cartoon}{2} are also proportional to $1/r$.

Now consider a wire such as the one in figure \subfigref{oersted}{2}. Such a wire is electrically neutral,
containing equal numbers of positive and negative charges. In the condition where charge
is flowing, the charges of one sign are standing still while the ones with the other
sign move. (In a metal wire, the moving charges are the electrons and the stationary
ones are the nuclei.) This is essentially the situation in figure
\subfigref{field-transformation-cartoon}{2}, except that the electric fields cancel out,
leaving a purely magnetic field. We conclude that when charges flow through a wire, the
magnetic field surrounding the wire is proportional to $1/r$. We'll work out the 
constants of proportionality in example \ref{eg:b-wire} on p.~\pageref{eg:b-wire}.

%>
<% end_marg %>

What is the direction of this field? 
It is not hard to show based on symmetry arguments that the radial component of the field
must be zero (\note{b-wire-not-radial}), and this is also suggested by
Oersted's experimental evidence
(figure \figref{oersted}, p.~\pageref{fig:oersted}).
Rather, the magnetic field circulates around the wire as shown in figure \figref{field-lines-of-wire}.
\end{eg}

In cases such as example \ref{eg:field-of-wire}, we find that the magnetic field
depends only (\note{b-propto-i}) on an electrical quantity called the \emph{current},\index{current}
defined as the number of coulombs per second that flow past a given point.
As with a river or a pipe carrying water, the same current could be created by a large amount
of charge moving slowly, or a small amount with a high velocity. Current is notated $I$,
and is defined formally as\label{current-defined}
\begin{equation*}
  I = \frac{\der q}{\der t}.
\end{equation*}
Its units are normally abbreviated as amperes (``amps''), 1 A=1 C/s.

%>
<% end_marg %>
A straight wire like the one in figure \figref{field-lines-of-wire} is not
usually a very efficient or compact way of making a strong magnetic field.
A more practical device is a solenoid, figure \figref{solenoid}. When very
strong fields are required, the field can be increased by an additional large
factor by adding a core made of a magnetic material such as iron. The mathematics
for calculating such fields will be deferred to later in this course.

The creation of magnetic fields is not the only effect associated with
currents.  For example, a current normally causes heating, as in an
electric heater or an old-fashioned incandescent lightbulb. Currents
can carry information.  Your nervous system operates using electric
currents carried by ions in your nerve cells.  So current is of great
practical interest in electrical circuits, which we will study more
intensively later in this course.  To measure current, there is a
device called an ammeter. (Today, people usually use a device called a
multimeter, which has multiple functions including working as an
ammeter.)\label{ammeter-intro} We will discuss the ammeter and its use
in more detail in sec.~\ref{subsec:measuring-current},
p.~\pageref{subsec:measuring-current}, when we begin our study of
electric circuits. 

Currents are formed by matter, and are \emph{not} the same thing as
electromagnetic fields, which can exist in a vacuum. For example, the
current in a copper wire is carried by electrons, whereas sunlight, an
electromagnetic wave, travels to the earth through outer space, which
is a vacuum.

When the current in an electric circuit is constant, so that charge is
flowing at a constant rate, this is referred to as direct current, or
DC. Household wall sockets are alternating current, AC, meaning that
the current oscillates as a function of time. In the US, electrical
power is transmitted as a sine wave with a frequency of 60 Hz. Radio
transmitting antennas use AC currents to create an electromagnetic
wave, and receiving antennas change the radio signal back to a
current. The frequency used in a cell phone is typically about $10^9\
\zu{Hz}$.

<% begin_sec("Energy, pressure, tension, and momentum in fields",nil,'stress-energy') %>
<% begin_sec("Momentum",nil,'momentum-of-em-fields') %>
Material objects can have energy, momentum, pressure, and tension.  We
have already seen that electric and magnetic fields have energy, and
we will soon see that they carry the other properties on this list as
well. Indeed, for an object like the suspension bridge in the photo on
p.~\pageref{ch:electromagnetism}, it is an illusion that the pressure
in the towers and the tension in the cables are provided by the steel.
Matter is essentially empty space with a sprinkling of pointlike subatomic
particles, and the pressure and tension in the bridge are in fact
properties of the electric and magnetic fields that exist in this
empty space. (Try not to think about this the next time you drive across
a bridge.)

There is a reason that we discussed the energy density of fields way
back in chapter \ref{ch:fields-intro}, but are only now getting to the
momentum density. This is because, for straightforward mathematical
reasons, momentum can never be carried by a pure electric or pure
magnetic field, but only by a combination of both. That is, the
momentum density is an electromagnetic property. To see this, consider
the fact that we have only two ways of multiplying vectors: the dot
product, which is a scalar, and the cross product, which is a vector.
(These operations were reviewed in sec.~\ref{subsec:dot-and-cross-product},
p.~\pageref{subsec:dot-and-cross-product}.)
Energy is a scalar, so it makes sense that the energy in the fields
goes like $\vc{E}\cdot\vc{E}$ and $\vc{B}\cdot\vc{B}$, i.e., like the
squared magnitudes of the fields. Momentum is a vector, so the
momentum density must be a cross product of the fields. But the cross
product of parallel vectors is always zero, so expressions like
$\vc{E}\times\vc{E}$ and $\vc{B}\times\vc{B}$ vanish identically and
are useless for our purposes. The momentum density must therefore be
proportional to $\vc{E}\times\vc{B}$, so it is a joint property of the
two fields. Filling in the correct constant of proportionality, which we'll come back
to in a moment, it turns
out that the momentum is given by
\begin{equation*}
  \der\vc{p} = \frac{1}{4\pi k} \vc{E}\times\vc{B} \der v.
\end{equation*}

        \end{align*}
      }
    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>%

The argument given above only demonstrated that the momentum density
had to be proportional to $\vc{E}\times\vc{B}$, but it didn't fix the
proportionality constant of $c^2/4\pi k$. The $c^2/k$ has to be there
because of units, but we might wonder why the unitless factor isn't
simply zero rather than $1/4\pi$.  After all, we don't notice this
momentum in everyday life; for example, when we turn on a flashlight,
it doesn't recoil like a gun. The answer is that the physical quantities
on the list we've been discussing --- energy, momentum, pressure, and tension --- are
not independent things. They're all intimately related.
For example, if we want to change the kinetic energy
of a car, we have to change its momentum as well (\note{p-related-to-ke}).
If a radio signal comes along and pumps kinetic energy into the electrons
in the antenna of your phone, then it's also transferring momentum to them,
and therefore it must have some momentum itself.

It is in fact plausible that the proportionality constant occurring in
the equation for the momentum density is such that the momentum of
light is too small to notice in everyday life. For material objects
moving at speeds small compared to $c$, the kinetic energy and
momentum are given by $K=(1/2)mv^2$ and $p=mv$, so that the ratio of
momentum to energy is $p/K=2/v$.\label{energy-momentum-ratio}
Therefore objects moving very fast
have very little momentum in proportion to their energy. We see this,
for example, in an old-fashioned CRT television tube, in which the
electron beam moves at extremely high speeds (perhaps $10^6\
\munit/\sunit$); the energy is enough to make a bright image on the
screen, but the device doesn't recoil from the beam's momentum when we
turn it on, nor does it shake and rattle as the the beam is steered
back and forth across the screen to paint the picture.  Although the
the equations above do not actually hold in detail for light (the
final result ends up being off by a factor of 2, as shown in sec.~\ref{subsec:p-plane-wave},
p.~\pageref{subsec:p-plane-wave}), it still makes sense
that the momentum-to-energy ratio is extremely small, because the
speed, $c$, is so big.

\begin{eg}{A comet's tail}\label{eg:halley}\index{Halley's comet}\index{comet}
Halley's comet, shown
in figure \figref{halley}, has a very elongated elliptical orbit, like those of
many other comets. About once per century, its orbit brings
it close to the sun. The comet's head, or nucleus, is
composed of dirty ice, so the energy deposited by the
intense sunlight gradually removes ice from the surface and turns it into water vapor.

The sunlight does not just carry energy, however. If it only carried
energy, then the water vapor would just form a spherical halo that
would surround the nucleus and travel along with it.  The light also
carries momentum. Once the steam comes off, the momentum of the
sunlight impacting on it pushes it away from the sun, forming a tail
as shown in in the top image.  (Some comets also have a second tail,
which is propelled by electrical forces rather than by the momentum of
sunlight.)

\begin{eg}{The Nichols radiometer}\label{eg:nichols-radiometer}
Figure \figref{nichols-radiometer} shows a simplified drawing of the
1903 experiment by Nichols and Hull that verified the predicted
momentum of light waves. Two circular mirrors were hung from a fine
quartz fiber, inside an evacuated bell jar. A 150 mW beam of light was
shone on one of the mirrors for 6 s, producing a tiny rotation, which
was measurable by an optical lever (not shown). The force was within
0.6\% of the theoretically predicted value of $0.001\
\mu\nunit$.\index{Nichols-Hull experiment on momentum of light} For
comparison, a short clipping of a human hair weighs $\sim 1\
\mu\nunit$. 
\end{eg}

Because the momentum of light waves is so small in cases like examples
\ref{eg:halley} and \ref{eg:nichols-radiometer}, one might wonder why
we should even bother discussing it. Is it purely an impractical and
theoretical consideration? The answer is that it is very practical in
the sense that it helps us to understand important practical facts
about these waves. 

One such fact is that disturbances in the electric and magnetic fields
are never purely electric waves or magnetic waves. They carry
momentum, and therefore they must contain an oscillation of both
fields. This is why phenomena like light and radio waves are referred
to as electromagnetic waves.\label{waves-not-pure-e-or-b}

We can also see that such waves must have fields with nonvanishing
components perpendicular to the direction in which the wave is
traveling, because the cross product $\vc{E}\times\vc{B}$ is
perpendicular to both $\vc{E}$ and $\vc{B}$.  In fact, for the simplest
wave patterns (such as a laser beam or a small enough piece of sunlight),
we will see that the fields are purely perpendicular to the direction
of propagation --- they have no component at all parallel to the momentum.
<% end_sec('momentum-of-em-fields') %>
<% begin_sec("Pressure and tension",nil,'pressure-of-em-fields') %>
Pressure is defined as the force per unit area, applied perpendicular to the
area. It has units of newtons per square meter, which can also be abbreviated
as pascals, 1 Pa=1 N/m. The earth's atmospheric pressure is about 100 kPa, and
car tires are usually inflated to about 250 kPa over atmospheric pressure.

Whenever momentum is transferred from one region of space to another,
pressure is involved, and in fact this is an equally valid definition
of pressure. For example, when a bat hits a baseball, the rate at which
momentum is transferred into the ball, per unit area, is the pressure.

Some materials can sustain tension, which is negative pressure. For example,
a rod can sustain either tension or pressure, but a rope can only sustain
tension --- you can't push with a rope.

In all of the examples above involving material objects, the pressure and tension
are in fact properties not of the objects but of the electric and magnetic fields,
which are the glue holding the atoms together. Although it is possible to give
formulas for the pressure and tension in the electromagnetic field, we will find
it more useful in this course to develop some visual rules for making accurate
inferences based on pictures of the fields.

  fig(

    %q{%
      Pressure and tension in the field of a parallel-plate capacitor. Side view.
    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

As a simple first example of these visual rules, consider the
arrangement in figure \figref{capacitor-pressure-and-tension}, in
which positive and negative charges are spread across two parallel
metal plates. This is called a capacitor.  The field is drawn by hand
to have roughly the features we would find if we added up the fields
of a large number of point charges on the two plates. The field lines
begin on the positive charges, which are the sources of the electric
field, and end on the negative ones, which are the sinks. The field is
nearly uniform on the interior and nearly zero on the exterior. To
understand the reason for this behavior, recall that for an infinite
plane of charge, the field is constant on both sides
(sec.~\ref{sec:gauss-in-lt-3-dim},
p.~\pageref{sec:gauss-in-lt-3-dim}). Since the two plates are
finite, their individual contributions to the total field are nearly
constant on either side of each one. If they were infinite, then these
fields would be exactly constant, and their sum would exactly cancel
on the exterior, while reinforcing on the interior.

We know from Coulomb's law that the positive and negative charges are
attracting one another, so the plates are being pulled toward each other.
The capacitor wants to collapse, and must be prevented from doing so
by some external structure (not shown). This is a tension in the vertical
direction. The field lines act like taut ropes.

We also know that within each plate, the like charges are all repelling
each other, and this would cause the plate to explode in the horizontal
direction, except that again there must be something else holding it together.
This is a kind of pressure. We see that pressure is exerted in the direction
perpendicular to the field lines, as if they were physical objects trying to
stay away from one another.

These are general rules, which apply to both the electric and the magnetic fields:
field lines sustain tension parallel to themselves, and pressure in the perpendicular
direction. Pressure and tension only produce mechanical effects when there is a
\emph{difference} in pressure or tension. For example, a car with a flat tire has
air pressure inside the tire, but there is no difference capable of creating
a net outward mechanical force on the rubber. In figure \figref{capacitor-pressure-and-tension},
the mechanical stresses on the capacitor exist because there is no field on the outside.

Figure \figref{two-charges-pressure-and-tension} shows two examples. In
\subfigref{two-charges-pressure-and-tension}{1}, the highlighted area between the
opposite charges contains field lines oriented horizontally, which create tension
in that direction. The charges attract one another. There is also pressure in the
vertical direction, but this is in the wrong direction to produce any effect on the
charges, which are separated from each other horizontally.

In  \subfigref{two-charges-pressure-and-tension}{2}, the highlighted area
between the two positive charges contains field lines that vertical pressure,
causing a repulsion between the charges, along with a horizontal tension which
has no effect on them.

In both examples in figure \figref{two-charges-pressure-and-tension}, we have highlighted
an area between the charges, but it also matters that there is a difference between the
pressure or tension in this area and that on the outside.

To see the advantage of this mode of reasoning, compare with the much
more complicated logic that we had to do on
p.~\pageref{fig:eg-two-charges-pe} in order to analyze
the situation \subfigref{two-charges-pressure-and-tension}{1} by talking about the change in the
fields' energy that would have occurred if they were moved closer together or farther apart.
(Cf.~also the complicated handling of the limits of integration in
note \notewithoutbackref{force-on-point-charge}.)

\begin{eg}{Magnetostriction}\label{eg:joule-magnetostriction}
The examples discussed above involved pressure and tension made by electric fields,
but an exactly analogous effect occurs for magnetism.
If you've ever heard a transformer buzzing, you've observed it.

Figure \figref{joule-magnetostriction} shows part of a sensitive experiment carried
out by James Joule in 1842 which discovered the effect. Joule writes, ``About the close of the year
1841, Mr.~F.D.~Arstall, an ingenious machinist of this town, suggested to me a new form
of electro-magnetic engine. He was of the opinion that a bar of iron experienced an increase
of bulk by receiving the magnetic condition.'' Joule first constructed a delicate experiment
to look for a change in the length of an iron bar when it was used as the core of a solenoid.
In an iron bar about half a meter tall, he found a \emph{decrease} in length of a little more than one
part per million, with the strongest field he could make. This effect is called
magnetostriction.

<% marg(50) %>
<%
  fig(
    'joule-magnetostriction',
    %q{Example \ref{eg:joule-magnetostriction}. The apparatus was about half a meter tall.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

This would suggest a decrease in volume as well, but there was no sufficiently accurate way to
measure the small diameter of the bar. Therefore Joule created the apparatus in figure
\figref{joule-magnetostriction}, in which the bar was submerged in water, with a thin capillary
tube at the top to take the volume of any small displacement of water and amplify it
into a visible change in height. The result was no detectable volume change.

These results seem natural in view of our picture of fields as carrying tension in the longitudinal
direction and pressure in the transverse direction. 
The interior field of the solenoid, as shown in figure \figref{solenoid}, runs in the vertical direction.
The lengthwise tension reduced the length of the
bar, but the transverse pressure expanded its diameter, and the result was that the volume stayed the same.

In the more familiar modern example of the
buzzing transformer, an AC current at 60 Hz creates oscillations at a frequency of 120 Hz.
This doubling of the frequency occurs
because the energy, pressure, and tension of a field all depend on the square
of the field, so that for a magnetic field, $\vc{B}$ produces the same effect as $-\vc{B}$. This means that
the maximum magnetostriction occurs twice per cycle, at both the peak and the trough of
the sine wave.

Figure \figref{wire-in-uniform-field} shows the superposition of two magnetic fields. 
One is a uniform field pointing to the left, and the other is the field of a wire carrying
a current that flows into the page. (The circle with a cross is a standard way of indicating
a direction into the page, meant to evoke the tail feathers of an arrow. A circle with a dot
would mean a direction out of the page.) To construct this diagram, we only needed vector
addition plus the facts about the magnetic field of a wire proved in example \ref{eg:field-of-wire}
on p.~\pageref{eg:field-of-wire}. Since that example did not include any derivation of the
constant of proportionality in the relationship $B\propto 1/r$, we can't say, in any particular
set of units, what is the current in the wire that would produce exactly this field pattern.

Since the pressure is greater below the wire than above
it, there is an upward force on the wire. Summarizing the geometrical relationship, we have:
\begin{align*}
  &\text{current into the page} \\
  &\text{$\vc{B}$ to the left} \\
  &\text{force up}.
\end{align*}
This is a right-hand rule, which smells like a cross product.
Since the cross product is the only rotationally invariant way to multiply two
vectors in order to get a third vector, the only possible force law consistent
with these observations is that
when a charged particle moves with velocity $\vc{v}$
through a magnetic field $\vc{B}$, the force acting on the particle is proportional
to $q\vc{v}\times\vc{B}$. The constant of proportionality has to be unitless,
and although we haven't yet proved it, this constant equals 1. Taking into account
the possibility that the particle is also acted on by an electric field, we have
\begin{equation*}
  \vc{F} = q\vc{E}+q\vc{v}\times\vc{B},
\end{equation*}
which is known as the Lorentz force law.

As an application, we can now describe how Thomson was able to measure the velocity
of the electrons in the experiment in which he discovered the electron. As
described in sec.~\ref{subsec:thomson}, p~\pageref{subsec:thomson}, he measured the
deflection of the electrons in an electric field, but he also determined how much
magnetic field, applied perpendicular to the beam, was necessary in order to produce
the same deflection. He then had $v=E/B$.

Figure \figref{compass-misaligned-field-lines} shows the superposition
of a compass needle's magnetic field (essentially the field of figure
\figref{bar-magnet-field-lines}, p.~\pageref{fig:bar-magnet-field-lines})
with the earth's magnetic field. The compass is not aligned with the earth's
field, and from what we know about magnetic compasses we expect that there will
be a torque that will tend to bring it into alignment.
It could in principle be very difficult to find this torque, since the magnetic field
pattern is so complicated. But by using the visual techniques of section
\ref{subsec:pressure-of-em-fields}, it's pretty easy to get the right answer for its sign.
There is tension at the top right and bottom left of the needle because of the
densely packed field lines. This tension will create a counterclockwise torque.

A real-world hiking compass is usually filled with water in order to create friction.
The needle vibrates about an equilibrium, but this friction rapidly kills the oscillations,
and it ends up in a state of lowest energy, in which it is aligned with the earth's
field (\note{compass-energy}). If we were to redraw figure \figref{compass-misaligned-field-lines}
for the equilibrium condition, it would have a left-right mirror symmetry, so the
torque must vanish, and this is consistent with equilibrium.

The reason we can treat the earth's field as uniform in this example is that the compass
is so small compared the earth. In this approximation, which is an excellent one in this
example, we can think of the compass as an idealized, very small object which feels no
net force from the field, only a torque.\footnote{To get a nonvanishing force from the earth's
magnetic field, we would have to have an isolated ``magnetic charge,'' and the apparent
nonexistence of such things is expressed by Gauss's law for magnetism.}
Such an idealized object is called a \emph{dipole}. There can be both electric and magnetic
dipoles. An electric dipole tends to align itself with the electric field.

If we change the orientation of a dipole, say a magnetic one, then its own contribution
to the field, $\vc{B}_1$ rotates along with it. Meanwhile, the external field
$\vc{B}_2$ remains constant. For a given orientation, the superposition of the two fields may be
something complicated like figure \figref{compass-misaligned-field-lines}. But regardless
of how complicated it is, the total energy of this field will always vary with orientation
in a very simple way: it is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the external field
and an axis, such as the long axis of the compass needle, determined by the structure of the
dipole (proof \note{dipole-energy-proof}). This is the behavior of a vector dot product, so
we have for the energy
\begin{equation*}
  U = -\vc{m}\cdot\vc{B},
\end{equation*}
where $\vc{m}$ is a vector called the dipole moment, and the minus sign is a matter of convention.

A mechanical analogy is that if a pendulum has length $\ell$ and mass $M$ at the end, then
we can define a vector with magnitude $\ell M$ and direction pointing from the axis
to the mass, and an identical expression holds for the energy of the pendulum in the
earth's gravitational field, since the height of the mass is just $-\ell\cos\theta$,
where $\theta$ is the displacement from equilibrium. But there is no such thing as
a pure gravitational dipole, because any material object in a gravitational field will
experience a net force as well as a torque.

We could try to be whimsical and get around this by putting a mass at one end of a stick
and a helium balloon at the other, tuning up the setup so that the whole thing was
neutrally buoyant. Less whimsically, this is similar to the simplest way of making an
\emph{electric} dipole: attach  charges $q$ and $-q$ to opposite ends of a stick of length $\ell$.
The result is an electric dipole moment, notated $\vc{D}$, with magnitude $\ell q$ and energy
\begin{equation*}
  U = -\vc{D}\cdot\vc{E}
\end{equation*}
in an external electric field.

\begin{eg}{Dipole moment of a molecule of NaCl gas}
        \egquestion
        In a molecule of NaCl gas (cf.~example \ref{eg:salt-crystal}, p.~\pageref{eg:salt-crystal}), the center-to-center
        distance between the two atoms is about 0.24 nm. Assuming
        that the chlorine completely steals one of the sodium's
        electrons, compute the magnitude of this molecule's dipole moment.

        \eganswer
        The total charge is zero, so it doesn't matter where we choose the
        origin of our coordinate system. For convenience, let's choose
        it to be at one of the atoms, so that the charge on that atom 
        doesn't contribute to the dipole moment.
         The magnitude of the dipole moment is then
        \begin{align*}
                         D         &=    (2.4\times10^{-10}\ \zu{m})( e)  \\
                                 &=    (2.4\times10^{-10}\ \zu{m})( 1.6\times10^{-19}\ \zu{C})  \\
                                 &\approx    4\times10^{-29}\ \zu{C}\cdot\zu{m}.
        \end{align*}
        The experimentally measured value is $3.0\times10^{-29}\ \zu{C}\cdot\zu{m}$, which shows
        that the electron is not completely ``stolen.''

Because the dot product has the linear property
$(\vc{D}_1+\vc{D}_2)\cdot\vc{E}=\vc{D}_1\cdot\vc{E}+\vc{D}_2\cdot\vc{E}$, it follows
from our definition of the dot product that dipole moments add like vectors (and otherwise
it would not have been legitimate to call them vectors).\footnote{This does not necessarily
hold for cases with infinitely many charges, as in example \ref{eg:long-molecule},
p.~\pageref{eg:long-molecule}.} Figure \figref{dipoles-add} shows a less abstract
justification for this, using dipoles made of charges $\pm q$.

Of course a complicated set of charges really is complicated, when you see it up close.
Figure \subfigref{dipole-zoomed-out}{1} shows the field pattern made by two positive charges
and two negative ones. It's very complicated, and it's not the same as the field pattern of
any two-charge dipole. But when we see it from far away, \subfigref{dipole-zoomed-out}{2}, it looks
very simple. It's common sense that you can't easily see the internal structure of an object
when you only look at it from far away.

So it's believable that all electric dipoles should have a similar field pattern at large distances
(taking into account their dipole moment and orientation), but what is that field pattern?
We've already seen in example \ref{eg:e-dipole-mid-plane} on p.~\pageref{eg:e-dipole-mid-plane}
and problem \ref{hw:dipole-axis} on p.~\pageref{hw:dipole-axis} that the field of a two-charge
dipole varies like $1/r^3$ at large distances, both in the mid-plane and on the axis.
This also holds true along any line through the dipole, not just lines like these that
are oriented in symmetrical ways. (To see this, express the dipole moment as a sum of components
perpendicular and parallel to the line.)

So in general, if we throw a bunch of charged particles in a sock, their field at large distances will
be proportional to the total charge, and will fall off like $1/r^2$, as we expect from Couolomb's
law. There will also be a dipole
field, but it falls off more quickly at large distances, so the Coulomb part dominates. But if we
happen to throw particles in the sock whose total charge is zero, then there is no $1/r^2$ part,
and the dominant field at large distance is the $1/r^3$ dipole field.
This is what happens, for example, with molecules that have nonzero dipole moments.

The universal form of electric dipole fields at large distances also holds for magnetic dipoles,
as discussed on p.~\pageref{e-b-dipole-same}. In mini-lab \ref{lab:bar-magnet-b-vs-r} you probably
found that the field went approximately like $1/r^2$ at the larger distances.

\begin{eg}{Molecules with zero and nonzero dipole moments}\label{eg:molecular-dipoles}
It can be useful to know whether or not a molecule is polar, i.e., has a nonzero dipole moment.
A polar molecule such as water is readily heated in a microwave oven, while a nonpolar one is not.
Polar molecules are attracted to one another, so polar substances dissolve in other polar substances,
but not in nonpolar substances, i.e., ``like dissolves like.''

In a symmetric molecule such as carbon disulfide, figure
\subfigref{molecular-dipoles}{1}, the dipole moment vanishes.
For if we rotate the molecule by 180 degrees about any one
of the three coordinate axes defined in the caption of the figure, the molecule is unchanged, which means
that its dipole moment is unchanged. The only vector that has these properties is
the zero vector.

Similar symmetry arguments show that sulfur hexafluoride, \subfigref{molecular-dipoles}{2}, and
benzene \subfigref{molecular-dipoles}{3}, have vanishing dipole moments.

The formaldehyde molecule, \subfigref{molecular-dipoles}{4}, does not have enough symmetry to guarantee
that its dipole moment must vanish, but it does have enough to dictate it must be equivalent
to a two-charge dipole lying along the left-right axis.
Chloroform, \subfigref{molecular-dipoles}{5}, is a front-to-back dipole for the
orientation drawn in the figure.

From these considerations we can tell, for example, that
carbon disulfide will be soluble in benzene, but chloroform will not.

Symmetry arguments are not enough to determine, for example, whether 
formaldehyde's dipole moment points to the left or to the right in the
figure. That requires some knowledge of
chemistry and the periodic table.

Often we observe static electrical interactions between a charged object and an object
that has zero total charge, \subfigref{attracting-induced-electric-and-magnetic-dipoles}{1}.
The mechanism is shown in figure \subfigref{attracting-induced-electric-and-magnetic-dipoles}{2}.
Although the scrap of paper has zero total charge, it does contain charges that can move.
The positive charges in the pipe attract the negative charges and repel the positive one,
turning the paper into a dipole. This is called an induced dipole moment.
The attraction is stronger than the repulsion, due to the
shorter distance, so the net force is attractive.

A fancier mathematical treatment of the effect is as follows.
If a dipole with zero total charge is placed in a uniform field, it may experience a torque, but
it will not experience any \emph{force}. The situation changes if the field is nonuniform.
The force in the $x$ direction is
\begin{equation*}
  F_x = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}.
\end{equation*}
We then have
\begin{equation*}
  F_x = -\frac{\partial }{\partial x}(\vc{D}\cdot\vc{E}) = \vc{D}\cdot\frac{\partial \vc{E}}{\partial x},
\end{equation*}
which depends on the dipole's properties only through $\vc{D}$. Similar expressions apply for the $y$ and $z$
components.

This principle can be used as a way of measuring the unknown dipole
moments of a beam of particles, as in figure
\figref{dipole-spectrometer-sideways}.  A magnetic version of this device was
used in the historic Stern-Gerlach experiment that discovered the spin
of the electron.

  )
%>
<% end_marg %>
Suppose you're given a black box, figure \figref{mass-energy}. You're not allowed to open it, but you're able
shake it around and measure its momentum.
By trial and error, you find that there is some frame in which 
its momentum is zero. (If there are things moving around inside, this
may not be the frame in which the externally visible cardboard sides of the
box are at rest.) This is what we might as well call the box's rest frame,
the frame in which it is at rest, in some over-all sense.

Next you can measure its nonzero momentum $p$ when you shake it around at various
velocities. Knowing $p$ at a particular $v$ allows you to infer the mass, $m=p/v$.

Now suppose you do this, not knowing that inside the box is an
electromagnetic field, which has \emph{zero} mass. The energies and
momenta you measure are those of the \emph{fields} alone.  You will
find a frame in which the momentum is zero. This could be a frame in
which the field is purely electric. If you now set the box in motion,
the original electric field pattern turns into a new electric field
plus a magnetic field pattern.\footnote{We assume that the fields are
transported with the cardboard box, so that the result of moving the
box at velocity $v$ is the same as if we left the box unaccelerated
and simply took our measurements while \emph{we} were moving at $v$.
In reality the results of accelerating the box would depend on the details of how the fields were
created and sustained.}  These electric and magnetic fields have some
momentum density, proportional to $\vc{E}\times\vc{B}$.  You measure
the total momentum. You infer a certain mass. 

Hm. This seems like mass without mass. There are no material particles inside the box,
and yet the box acts like it has mass.

Suppose that the field is purely electric in the box's rest frame, and we have
a way to make this electric field stronger or weaker.  When we do this and
then set the box in motion, the energy of the
fields and the mass we infer change by equal factors. For example, if
we increase the electric field by a factor of 3, then the energy goes
up by a factor of 9. But when the box is moving, this also has the
effect of multiplying $\vc{B}$ by a factor of 3, so $\vc{E}\times\vc{B}$ goes up
by a factor of 9. This means that the momentum goes up by 9 times, and so does
the mass that we infer at a given velocity.
<% end_sec('fields-carry-inertia') %>

<% begin_sec("Equivalence of mass and energy",nil,'mass-energy-equiv-for-fields') %>
In this example, energy and mass are \emph{equivalent}. Based on
units, the relation must be of the form $E=(\text{constant})mc^2$,
where the constant is unitless.  Einstein showed that the unitless
constant was equal to 1, and was the same for any system, regardless
of what type or types of energy are involved.\footnote{Here the
``system'' has to be an isolated one. If the system is not isolated,
then it can be exchanging energy and momentum with the outside world.
The analysis then gets more complicated, and $E=mc^2$ can be false.} This is the famous $E=mc^2$,
which states that mass and energy are equivalent.

The equation $E=mc^2$ tells us how much energy is equivalent to how
much mass: the conversion factor is the square of the speed of light,
$c$. Since $c$ a big number, you get a really really big number when
you multiply it by itself to get $c^2$. This means that even a small
amount of mass is equivalent to a very large amount of energy.
Conversely, an ordinary amount of energy corresponds to an extremely
small mass (example \ref{eg:rustingnail}), and this is why nobody
discovered mass-energy equivalence experimentally hundreds of years before
Einstein.

A full treatment of this topic would be outside the scope of this
book, but it's fairly easy to see that if mass is equivalent to one
form of energy, then it must be equivalent to all other forms of
energy, with the same conversion factor.  Let's take heat as an
example.  Suppose a rocket ship contains some electrical energy stored
in a battery. What if we believed that $E=mc^2$ applied to electromagnetic
energy but not to heat. Then the pilot of the rocket could use a battery
to run a heater, decreasing the mass of the ship. Since momentum $p=mv$ is conserved,
this would require that the ship speed up!

This would not only be strange, but it would violate the principle
that motion is relative, because the result of the experiment would be
different depending on whether the ship was at rest or not. The only
logical conclusion is that all forms of energy are equivalent to mass.
Running the heater then has no effect on the motion of the ship,
because the total energy in the ship was unchanged; one form of energy
(electrical) was simply converted to another (heat).

A somewhat different, and equally valid, way of looking at $E=mc^2$ is that
energy and mass are not separately conserved. Therefore we can have processes
that convert one to the other.

\begin{eg}{A rusting nail}\label{eg:rustingnail}
\egquestion
An iron nail is left in a cup of water
until it turns entirely to rust. The energy released is
about 0.5 MJ. In theory, would a sufficiently
precise scale register a change in mass? If so, how much?

\eganswer
 The energy will appear as heat, which will be lost
to the environment. The total mass-energy of the cup,
water, and iron will indeed be lessened by 0.5 MJ. (If it
had been perfectly insulated, there would have been no
change, since the heat energy would have been trapped in the
cup.) The speed of light is
$c=3\times10^8$ meters per second, so converting to mass units, we have
\begin{align*}
                m         &=    \frac{E}{c^2}  \\
                        &= \frac{0.5\times10^6\ \junit}{\left(3\times10^8\ \munit/\sunit\right)^2} \\
                         &=    6\times10^{-12}\  \text{kilograms}\eqquad.
\end{align*}
The change in mass is too small to measure with any
practical technique. This is because the square of the speed
of light is such a large number.

\begin{eg}{Electron-positron annihilation}\label{eg:eplus-eminus}\index{positron}
Natural radioactivity in the earth produces positrons, which are like electrons but have the
opposite charge. A form of antimatter, positrons annihilate with electrons to produce gamma
rays, a form of high-frequency light. Such a process would have been considered impossible
before Einstein, because conservation of mass and energy were believed to be separate
principles, and this process eliminates 100\% of the original mass. The amount of energy
produced by annihilating 1 kg of matter with 1 kg of antimatter is
\begin{align*}
 E &= mc^2\\
   &= (2\ \kgunit)\left(3.0\times10^8\ \munit/\sunit\right)^2\\
   &= 2\times10^{17}\ \junit\eqquad,

which is on the same order of magnitude as a day's energy consumption for the
entire world's population!

Positron annihilation forms the basis for the medical imaging technique called

\notetext{b-wire-not-radial}{Direction of the magnetic field of a wire}
\notesummary{The magnetic field of a current-carrying wire has no radial component.}
Let a line of charge, with constant positive charge density, lie along the $x$ axis,
at rest in frame of reference 1. In frame 1, at a certain point on the $y$
axis, there is a radial electric field $E_y$ and no magnetic field.

Now let frame 2 be moving to the right with speed $u$,
and suppose that the magnetic field this point did have a nonzero radial
component $B_y$ in this frame.

Or, reversing the direction of motion, let frame 3 be moving with velocity $-u$ in the $x$ direction.
Because the magnetic field is proportional to the current, the magnetic field
at our point of interest must be $-B_y$, as described by an observer in this frame.

But this is untenable, because the transformation of the fields must take as its inputs
only the vectors $\vc{E}$ and $\vc{u}$, the velocity of the frame of reference relative to
the original frame. The vector $\vc{u}$ could have any direction in the $x$-$z$ plane, and
there is not enough information in these inputs to determine, by any rotationally
invariant function, the sign of $B_y$.


\notetext{b-propto-i}{Proportionality of magnetic field to current}
\notesummary{The magnetic field created by a current is exactly proportional to the current.}
It is not surprising that the magnetic field of a current-carrying wire, as in example
\ref{eg:field-of-wire}, p.~\pageref{eg:field-of-wire}, is approximately proportional to
the current. This must be so based on the fact that the transformation of the fields
is additive and is smooth as a function of the velocity. What is more remarkable is
that this proportionality to the current is \emph{exact} at all velocities. We will
see later that there is theoretical justification for this fact.

\notetext{p-related-to-ke}{Newtonian relation between momentum and kinetic energy}
\notesummary{As an example of the intimate relationship between momentum and kinetic
energy, the momentum of material objects must be conserved in Newtonian mechanics if

The basic insight can be extracted from the special case where there
are only two particles interacting, and they only move in one dimension,
Conservation of energy says
\begin{equation*}
        K_{1i}+K_{2i}+U_i = K_{1f}+K_{2f}+U_f\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
For simplicity, let's assume that the interactions start after the time we're calling
initial, and end before the instant we choose as final. Then there is no change in
potential energy, $U_i=U_f$, and we can subtract the
potential energies from both sides, giving.
\begin{align*}
        K_{1i}+K_{2i} &= K_{1f}+K_{2f}  \\
        \frac{1}{2}m_1v_{1i}^2+\frac{1}{2}m_2v_{2i}^2 
                        &= \frac{1}{2}m_1v_{1f}^2+\frac{1}{2}m_2v_{2f}^2\eqquad.
\end{align*}
In a frame of reference moving at velocity $u$
relative to the first one, the velocities all have $u$ added onto them:
\begin{multline*}
                        \frac{1}{2}m_1(v_{1i}+u)^2+\frac{1}{2}m_2(v_{2i}+u)^2 \\
                                = \frac{1}{2}m_1(v_{1f}+u)^2+\frac{1}{2}m_2(v_{2f}+u)^2 
\end{multline*}
When we square a quantity like $(v_{1i}+u)^2$, we get the same $v_{1i}^2$ that
occurred in the original frame of reference, plus two $u$-dependent terms,
$2v_{1i}u+u^2$. Subtracting the original conservation of energy equation
from the  version in the new frame of reference, we have
        \begin{align*}
                m_1v_{1i}u+m_2v_{2i}u = m_1v_{1f}u+m_2v_{2f}u\eqquad, \\
                \intertext{or, dividing by $u$,}
                m_1v_{1i}+m_2v_{2i} = m_1v_{1f}+m_2v_{2f}\eqquad.
        \end{align*}
This is a statement of conservation of momentum.

\notetext{compass-energy}{Minimizing the energy of a compass needle}
\notesummary{We discuss the minimization of the energy in the magnetic field of a compass needle.}
The result of our analysis of figure \figref{compass-misaligned-field-lines} on
p.~\pageref{fig:compass-misaligned-field-lines} tells us that the compass needle will
tend to align itself so that its own internal field is in the same direction as the
ambient field. This is a little surprising, since the energy stored in the magnetic
field on the interior is then increased. However, the needle also contributes to the
field \emph{outside} itself, and this field is predominantly in the opposite direction
compared to the interior field. It's true but not obvious that this smaller exterior
field, integrated over the large exterior volume, ends up being the dominant effect.

\notetext{dipole-energy-proof}{Dipole's energy proportional to cosine of an angle}
\notesummary{We prove that the energy of a dipole in an external field is proportional
to the cosine of the angle between the field and some internal axis determined by the structure of the
dipole.}
In the notation introduced in the main text, $\vc{B}_1$ is the field of the dipole,
$\vc{B}_2$ the uniform external field. The  energy density of the total magnetic field at
any given point is proportional to $(\vc{B}_1+\vc{B}_2)\cdot(\vc{B}_1+\vc{B}_2)$, with the
only variation occurring because the whole field pattern represented by $\vc{B}_1$ can be
rigidly rotated. Multiplying out the factors of the dot product, and discarding constant
terms, we have $2\vc{B}_1\cdot\vc{B}_2$. The variable part of the
total energy is found by integrating this expression over all space, but $\vc{B}_2$ is a constant,
so we can take it outside the integral, the result being $\vc{B}_2\int \ldots \der v$, where $\ldots$
represents whatever field is going on inside the dipole. This has the form of a vector dot product,
which is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the two factors.

The figure shows a cross-sectional side view of a solenoid. The central axis
runs from left to right. The idea of this lab is to hang a permanent magnet, which
acts as a magnetic dipole, from a string, precisely located in the end-plane of
the solenoid. The oscillation of the magnet about the solenoid's axis is exactly
mathematically equivalent to the motion of a pendulum, so the period $T$ and
the magnetic field $B$ supplied by the solenoid are related by $T\propto B^{-1/2}$.
If superposition holds, then
the field can be precisely doubled by bringing in a second solenoid, oriented the
same way, so that one of its end-planes coincides with the dipole as well.

In order to create the magnetic field of the solenoid, a current is needed.
When this current is established, and the magnetic field pops up, the field takes
in some energy. This energy comes from a 1.5 V battery. In addition, once the circuit is hooked
up, there is a continuous slow dissipation of energy to heat as the current flows
through the copper wires, and the battery supplies this energy as well. The rate
of heat dissipation is only about a milliwatt, so there is no danger that the battery
will die. To make this work, you need to make a \emph{complete circuit}, meaning that
there is a closed loop of wire going from one terminal of the battery to one terminal
of the solenoid, through the solenoid, back through another wire, and ending up
at the other terminal of the battery.

In order to keep the current exactly constant, it is necessary to hook up both
solenoids to the battery throughout the whole lab, not just when the second solenoid
is needed. The cables are long enough so that it can be put far enough away (half a
meter or so) so that its small external field will have no effect on the results
when only the original solenoid's field is desired.

The solenoids should be wired
in \emph{series}, so that any charge that passes through one must also pass through
the other. A series circuit is like a necklace with beads on it. The opposite of
a series circuit is a parallel circuit, which has junctions giving the electrons
choices about which way to go at certain points.

Furthermore, the oscillations of the permanent magnet are rather fast and rapidly
damped unless the current is reduced a little. We will do this by adding a component
called a resistor to the circuit. The resistor dissipates additional energy as heat.

So, including all the parts, your series circuit will look like a necklace with the
following ``beads'' around its circumference: battery, resistor, solenoid, solenoid,
and back to the battery again. The order of the circuit elements in the loop actually
has no effect on the results; because charge is conserved, it is not possible for charge
to get lost or used up on its way around the circuit.

A complication comes from the ambient field in the room, which is a combination of the
earth's field and the field of the building materials. This field is a fraction of that
of the solenoids, but still significant enough to affect the results. To deal with this,
we will intentionally align the solenoids with the horizontal component of the ambient field, so that the
vector addition of the horizontal fields is equivalent to addition of real numbers.
Then we will take data with the current flowing in both directions, so that in one
cases the ambient field adds to the field of the solenoid(s) and in the other it subtracts.
Averaging the periods in these two conditions eliminates the effect of the ambient field.
