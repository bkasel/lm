Sometimes in physics, as in life, we may not realize that there is a piece
missing from a puzzle. To see that there is such a missing piece in our
description of the electric field, consider the following seemingly minor
technical issue. In figures \subfigref{capacitor-possible-and-impossible}{1}
and \subfigref{capacitor-possible-and-impossible}{2}, we have two fields, either
of which we could imagine was the correct field for a parallel-plate capacitor
in a state of static equilibrium. 

<% marg() %>

  fig(
    'capacitor-possible-and-impossible',
    %q{%
      Which is the correct electric field for the parallel-plate capacitor?
    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

We would expect some physical law to tell us which was correct, but either
is consistent with Gauss's law, because the field lines begin on positive
charges and end on negative ones. This is a hint that we need some additional
law of physics if we are to be able to fully predict the behavior of electric
fields.

Experiments show that \subfigref{capacitor-possible-and-impossible}{2}
is right and \subfigref{capacitor-possible-and-impossible}{1} is
wrong, and a hint as to what's going on is provided by the following
argument. Suppose we take a positive test charge and move it around
the rectangular closed path ABCDA, shown in figure
\subfigref{capacitor-possible-and-impossible}{3} superimposed on the
simpler-looking field pattern from
\subfigref{capacitor-possible-and-impossible}{1}, in which the field is zero
outside the capacitor. The field does positive
work on the charge from B to C, but zero work along the other edges of
the rectangle. Energy is released, but nothing has changed about the field
pattern, so we can repeat the cycle as many times as we like. This is
a perpetual motion machine, and it violates conservation of energy.

The field in figure \subfigref{capacitor-possible-and-impossible}{2}
fixes the problem. Although the field is weaker outside the capacitor, it does
some negative work along DA. Furthermore, the field has horizontal components
that do negative work along AB and CD. The field has been carefully contrived
so that the total work done by the field around the rectangle is zero.

For a static field, i.e., one that doesn't change as a function of time,
we want this to be true in general:

\begin{lessimportant}
The work done by a static electric field on a test charge, as the charge
moves around a closed loop, is always zero.
\end{lessimportant}

A field that satisfies this criterion is referred to as conservative or,
for reasons that will become clear soon, irrotational.

Non-static electric fields do not have to be conservative. For
example, when you go out in the sun on a hot day, the sunlight heats
your skin. As the light wave oscillates, it does work on the charged
particles in your body, and it does so over and over again, for as
long as you continue your sunbath. Although we refer to this electric
field as ``nonconservative,'' there is no violation of conservation of
energy. The energy gained by your body as heat is balanced by the loss
of the electric and magnetic energy of the light waves, which pass
into nonexistence as they are absorbed.

We expect the laws of physics to be expressible in a way that is purely
local, so it should be good enough if the conservative property of a static electric
field holds in the limit of very small closed loops. In fact, we will see that
if the conservative property holds for small loops, then it is also automatically
satisfied for small ones as well. This is guaranteed by a theorem called Green's
theorem, which looks scary when expressed in fancy mathematical notation, but
expresses a fact that turns out to be visually obvious.

    %q{%
      The curl-meter, and the right-hand rule for making its reading into a vector.

  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

To make these ideas more concrete, we define an imaginary device called the
curl-meter, shown in figure \figref{curlmeter-fac}. A set of positive charges
is mounted around the circumference of a wheel, and a coil spring connects
the wheel to its supporting axle, so that in the absence of any electrical
forces, the wheel turns to a certain equilibrium orientation. If the curl-meter
is immersed in a nonconservative electric field, then it may respond by rotating, and
the torque that it measures is an indication of how badly nonconservative
the field is. This is obviously not a practical, real-world device, but it is
easy to make one in the real world out of an oscilloscope and a coil of wire.
The basic idea of such devices is that they are like paddlewheels that will spin
if inserted in a whirlpool.

The reading on the curl-meter, called the ``curl'' of the field,
depends on its orientation, and this suggests that
its reading is a vector, not a scalar like the divergence.
Indeed, in the physical realization of figure \figref{curlmeter-fac}, the
reading comes out as a torque, and torque is a vector. Therefore we have
a right-hand rule for expressing the curl, which is the same as the right-hand
rule for torques. It is possible to express the curl in terms of the partial
derivatives of the field's components, but detailed mathematical manipulations
in that style are not necessary in order to follow the logical backbone of the
presentation in this book, so we relegate this material to a note
(\note{curl-component-form}). Figure \figref{div-and-curl-examples} shows some visual examples.
<%
  fig(
    'div-and-curl-examples',
    %q{Some electric fields with zero and nonzero divergences and curls.},
    {'width'=>'wide'}
  )
%>

In turns of the curl, we have the following local law of physics:

\begin{lessimportant}
For a static electric field, $\operatorname{curl}\vc{E}=0$.
\end{lessimportant}

\noindent This means that the work done around any \emph{small} closed loop is zero.
Let's see how this generalizes to large loops. Green's theorem comes in a variety of
versions and different levels of generality (e.g., there is a version that works in
four dimensions, which is helpful in relativity, where time is treated as a dimension).
For now we'll content ourselves with the special case that covers two dimensions, in the case
where the curl is zero. (More general versions of Green's theorem tell us interesting
things in the more general case where the curl can be nonzero.) For a field in a two-dimensional
plane, the curl would point in the direction perpendicular to the plane, but we're now
talking about the case where the curl is zero, so that issue doesn't arise.

In figure \figref{green-simple}, we construct the small square path ABCDA. This is small
enough so that our local law $\operatorname{curl}\vc{E}=0$ guarantees, to good enough
precision, that the work done on a charge around this path is zero. This approximation can
be made as good as desired by making the squares small enough. The same thing works for
the adjoining square DCEFD, using the same counterclockwise direction of motion.
Now when we join the two squares together to make the rectangle ABEFA, something
nice happens: the work done around the rectangle equals the \emph{sum} of the works done
around the two squares. The reason this is true is that in the first square we go up from C to
D, while in the other we go down, so when we add the works for the two squares, these two
contributions cancel. By the way, there is nothing special about squares --- this holds for
any shapes having an adjoining boundary.

It is now clear that we can continue in this way and construct a grid that covers a piece
of the plane of unlimited size, so that, for example, we know there is zero work done around
the perimeter of the irregular shape shown in the figure. By making the grid fine enough,
we can approximate any shape to the desired level of approximation, so the work done around any
closed path is zero.

Although our main topic in this chapter is the electric field, it is also true that
static magnetic fields in a vacuum obey the same equations: 
$\operatorname{div} \vc{B}=0$ and $\operatorname{curl}\vc{B}=0$. This is the underlying reason
why, at large distances, electric and magnetic dipole fields have the same universal form:
the same equations have the same solutions.\label{e-b-dipole-same}

The earth's gravitational field has zero curl, and this is why it makes sense to define the
gravitational potential energy of a test mass in the earth's field.
If we lift the ball in figure \figref{path-independent-gravity} along path 1, then
lower it by completing the loop along path 2, the total work done by the
gravitational field is zero. This implies that if we lift along path 2, reversing
the sign of the work, the amount of work done is the same as along path 1. That is,
the work done by gravity is \emph{path-independent}. We can therefore pick some reference point,
such as the lower position, define the ball's gravitational potential energy to be
zero there, and define the potential energy at any other point to be the work done by
the hand to get from the reference point to that point. The definition is unambiguous
because its result does not depend on the path taken.

In the context of the gravitational field, it is of interest to define the gravitational
potential energy per unit mass; we don't need a special scientific name for this, because
it is simply the height relative to the reference point.

Making the analogy with static electric fields, we define an electric
potential $\phi$, which is the energy per unit charge required in
order to move a test charge to a certain point, from a reference point. It has units
of joules per coulomb, which can be abbreviated as volts, 1 V=1 J/C.
In real-life electrical work, we may take the reference point to be a
convenient object such as a water pipe. In theoretical contexts, it is
often convenient to take the reference point to be infinitely far
away. In informal contexts, people often refer to potential as voltage,
and the notation $V$ can also be used instead of $\phi$.

\begin{eg}{Potential surrounding a point charge}
Given a point charge $Q$, the potential energy of a test charge $q$ at a distance
$r$ is $kQq/r$. Dividing by the test charge, we find that the potential is
\begin{equation*}
  \phi = \frac{kQ}{r}.
\end{equation*}
\end{eg}

A battery is a device that maintains a desired potential difference between
its two terminals.

The instrument for measuring electric potentials is called a
voltmeter (these days usually implemented as one of the functions of
a multimeter). The voltmeter has no way of knowing what mental choice we had
in mind as our reference potential, so all it can do is tell us the
potential \emph{difference} between two points,
\begin{equation*}
  \Delta\phi = \frac{\Delta U}{q}.
\end{equation*}
The meter has two plugs, which can be connected with wires to the two
points of interest. The meter allows a tiny trickle of charge to flow
in one wire, through the meter, and out the other, and it measures the
work done by the electric field along this path. The potential difference
$\Delta\phi$ is then minus the work divided by the charge.

Figure \figref{using-voltmeter} shows a multimeter set up to be used as a
voltmeter, and a person using such a meter to measure a potential difference.
In the close-up, we see that one wire has been plugged into the COM plug
(so called because it is used for all functions of the meter), while the
other wire is plugged into the one marked V. The rotary dial is turned to V
for a voltage measurement. (The position marked V with the sine wave icon would be used for
measuring an alternating current, i.e., a voltage that was oscillating over
time rather than static. The marked mV would be used for measuring small voltages.)
The digital readout reads the potential difference (V plug minus COM plug), in units
of volts.
Such meters are more or less standardized, so this description applies to all multimeters,
with minor variations such as the possible use of an analog display with a needle, or
pushbuttons rather than a rotary dial.

In the right-hand side of figure \figref{using-voltmeter}, the woman using the
voltmeter is touching the metal tips of the two probes to two different points,
a piece of exposed wire in the rat's nest of wiring, and a point on the chassis.
The reading on the meter will be the difference in electric potential between these
two points.

<% end_sec('potential') %>

<% begin_sec("Constant potential throughout a conductor",nil,'const-v-in-conductor') %>
In figure \figref{using-voltmeter}, the woman is using a point on the metal chassis of the
electrical box as a reference. It looks like she's chosen a screw hole as a convenient
place to make good electrical contact. This choice of a reference potential is arbitrary, and so
we might imagine that although it would be equally valid to pick some other point on the chassis
as a reference, the readings might then all be offset by some constant. In fact, we would find
that the readings were all the same, because there will be no difference in potential between one
point on the box and another.

The reason for this has to do with the fact
that a metal contains a large number of electrons that are free to move.
A substance like this that has many free charge carriers is called a conductor. The living cells
in your body (although not the dead ones in the dry outer layer of skin) are pretty good conductors,
because they have free charge carriers such as positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged
chlorine ions, coming from the salt in your body. A good conductor cannot sustain a potential
difference between different points within itself. If such a difference were set up, the
charges would immediately begin to flow. Any positive charges would move toward the lower
potential (as water, with positive mass, flows downhill), while negative charges would flow
toward the higher potential. The system would rapidly reach an equilibrium in which the potential
differences were eliminated. In the study of electrostatics, there are by definition no currents
or time-varying fields, and therefore all charges must be in equilibrium, and this would be impossible
if there were any differences in potential within a conductor.

        Excess charge placed on a conductor, once it
        reaches its equilibrium configuration, is entirely on the
        surface, not on the interior (proof \note{no-charge-on-interior}). This should be intuitively reasonable
        in figure \figref{doorknob}, for example, since the charges are all
        repelling each other. 

\begin{eg}{The lightning rod}\label{eg:lightning-rod}
 Suppose you have a pear-shaped conductor like the one
        in figure \subfigref{lightning-rod}{1}.  Since the pear is a conductor,
        there are free charges everywhere inside it. Panels 1 and 2 of the figure show
        a computer simulation with 100 identical electric charges. In 1, the charges
        are released at random positions inside the pear. Repulsion causes them all
        to fly outward onto the surface and then settle down into an orderly but nonuniform
        pattern. 

        We might not have been able to guess the pattern in advance, but we can
        verify that some of its features make sense. For example, charge A has more neighbors
        on the right than on the left, which would tend to make it accelerate off to the left.
        But when we look at the picture as a whole, it appears reasonable that this is prevented
        by the larger number of more distant charges on its left than on its right.

        There also seems to be a pattern to the nonuniformity: the charges collect more
        densely in areas like B, where the surface is strongly curved, and less densely in flatter areas like C.

      Example \ref{eg:lightning-rod}. In 1 and 2, charges that are visible on the front surface of the conductor

      imagine is semi-transparent.
    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

To understand the reason for this pattern, consider \subfigref{lightning-rod}{3}.
Two conducting spheres are connected by a conducting wire. Since the whole apparatus
is conducting, it must all be at one voltage. As shown in problem \ref{hw:lightning-rod}
on p.~\pageref{hw:lightning-rod}, the density of charge is greater on the smaller
sphere. This is an example of a more general fact observed in \subfigref{lightning-rod}{2}, which is that the charge on
a conductor packs itself more densely in areas that are more sharply curved.

Similar reasoning shows why Benjamin Franklin used a sharp
        tip when he invented the lightning rod. The charged stormclouds
        induce positive and negative charges to move to opposite
        ends of the rod.  At the pointed upper end of the rod, the
        charge tends to concentrate at the point, and this charge
        attracts the lightning. The same effect can sometimes be seen when
        a scrap of aluminum foil is inadvertently put in a microwave oven. Modern experiments (Moore \emph{et al.},
        Journal of Applied Meteorology 39 (1999) 593) show that although
        a sharp tip is best at starting a spark, a more moderate curve,
        like the right-hand tip of the pear in this example, is better
        at successfully sustaining the spark for long enough to connect
        a discharge to the clouds.

Work equals force times distance, $\der W=F\der x$, so when the electric field does work
on a test charge, the energy lost by the field is $\der U = -Eq\der x$,
and dividing by $q$ and solving for $E$ gives
\begin{equation*}
  E = -\frac{\der\phi}{\der x}.
\end{equation*}
The minus sign reflects the plumber's basic aphorism that shit flows downhill:
if we release a positive charge at rest in an electric field, the field will
accelerate the charge in the direction of lower $\phi$ --- lower ``height.''
In a different gravitational analogy, the two skateboarders in figure
\figref{skaters-on-different-slopes} will have very different net forces
acting on them. The one on the steep positive slope will be accelerated
much more rapidly in the negative direction.

\egquestion
Suppose an electric eel is 1 m long, and
generates a voltage difference of 1000 volts between its
head and tail. What is the electric field in the water around it?

\eganswer
We are only calculating the amount of field, not
its direction, so we ignore positive and negative signs.
The field is probably not constant, but we don't have enough information to take
that into account, so let's say it's constant. In general, a derivative 
$\der\ldots/\der\ldots$ can always be approximated by an expression of the
form $\Delta\ldots/\Delta\ldots$ when the value of the derivative is constant, i.e.,
you don't need calculus to find a rate of change that is constant. Therefore we have
\begin{align*}
 |E| &\approx \frac{\Delta \phi}{\Delta  x} \\
     &=    1000\ \zu{V/m}.

\begin{eg}{Weighing an electron}\label{eg:tolman-stewart}
J.J.~Thomson (p.~\pageref{subsec:thomson}) is considered to have
discovered the electron because he measured its charge-to-mass ratio
$q/m$ and found it to be much larger than that of an ionized atom,
interpreting this as evidence that he was seeing a subatomic particle
with a mass much small than an atom's.  But not only is the electron's
$q/m$ relatively large compared to that of an atom, it is simply a
huge number ($\sim-10^{11}\ \zu{C}/\kgunit$) when expressed in SI
units. SI units are designed for human scales of experience, so this
suggests that in everyday life we should expect it to be very
difficult to detect any effect from the weight or inertia of an
electron. 

As an example, suppose that a metal rod of length $L$ is oriented
upright. The conduction electrons are free to move, so they would tend
to drop to the bottom of the rod. Electrical forces will however
resist this segregation of positive and negative charges. To estimate
how hard it would be to observe such an effect, let us imagine
connecting the probes of a voltmeter to the ends of the rod. In
equilibrium, the electrical and gravitational fields must have effects
on an electron that cancel out. Setting the magnitudes of these forces
equal to each other, we have $eE=mg$, and since (ignoring signs) $E=\Delta \phi/L$, we
predict a potential difference $\Delta \phi=(m/q)gL$. For a one-meter rod,
the predicted effect is $\sim10^{-10}\ \zu{V}$. 

This is quite small, but not impossible to measure, and the
theoretical prediction was confirmed for a similar experiment by
Tolman and Stewart in a 1916 experiment at Berkeley.  This was the
first direct evidence that the charge carriers inside a metal wire are
in fact electrons.  Similarly, we do expect mechanical side-effects in
any electrical circuit, e.g., a slight twitching of a flashlight when
we turn it on or off, but these will be much too small to notice
except with exceptionally delicate and sensitive
tools.\index{Tolman-Stewart experiment}

It is surprising that we can get information about the microscopic structure of a metal merely by measuring
its properties in this way.

In a vacuum in one dimension, Gauss's law is that $\der E/\der x=0$, and since $E=-\der\phi/\der x$,
we have
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\der^2 \phi}{\der x^2} = 0. \qquad \text{[vacuum, one dimension]}
\end{equation*}
This is the simplest form of various equations known as Laplace's equation (or Poisson's equation, in
a generalized version where charges are present).
The second derivative is a measure of curvature, so this equation states that the graph
of the potential as a function of position is a straight line. Another
nice ways of saying this is that the potential at a certain point is equal to the average
of its values at nearby points on either side.

Figure \figref{need-boundary-conditions} shows two examples (left and right columns) in which
there are essentially the same charges present: a vertical strip of positive charges on the left,
and a strip of negative ones on the right. This is effectively a one-dimensional problem.
In both cases, Gauss's law is obeyed, because the field lines begin on positive charges and
end on negative ones.

    %q{Two different fields for essentially the same charge distribution.},

Even though the charges are the same, the fields are different. This shows that problems in
electrostatics may not have unique solutions if we are only told about the distribution of
charge and nothing else. As an even simpler example, we could have simply used a region of
vacuum, with no charges at all, and any uniform field (including a zero field) would have been
a solution.

In each example, there are three regions of vacuum, and in each of these we can observe that
the function $\phi(x)$ is a straight line. In the regions where there are charges, $\phi(x)$
is a curve, and $\der^2\phi/\der x^2\ne 0$. In terms of the potentials, the difference between
the two cases is that $\phi_2-\phi_1$ is a linear function. The second derivative of a linear
function is zero, so both are consistent with Laplace's equation.

In terms of the fields, $E_2-E_1$ is a uniform field.

To get a unique solution to this type of electrostatics problem, we need to specify some
\emph{boundary conditions}. For example, if we required that the field be zero at large distances
(as $x\rightarrow\pm\infty$), then we would have uniquely specified $E_1$ as a solution.

If you haven't already had a course in differential equations, you may not have heard of
boundary conditions, but they are omnipresent in the physical sciences and engineering, and you
have already been using them without knowing it. As a simple
example, suppose that a hockey puck is gliding frictionless across some ice. There is a law of
physics, Newton's second law, stating that $\der^2x/\der t^2=0$. Any linear function would be
a solution of this equation, since the puck can move at any constant speed, in either direction.
However, if we specify the puck's position at two times, then the linear function is uniquely
determined. The two given positions are two points on the graph of $x(t)$, and if we connect
them with a line segment, they are the segments left and right boundaries.

Boundary conditions can have a variety of forms, and the word ``boundary''
isn't always literal. For example, we could have given the hockey puck's
initial position and velocity rather than its initial and final positions.

In electrostatics, no physically verifiable boundary conditions can
ever completely fix the potential, since only differences in potential
are measurable. Another way of saying this is that it is the electric
field that is measurable, and therefore the indefinite integral
$\phi=-\int E\der x$ will always have an arbitrary constant of
integration. We might wish, for example, to set $\phi=0$ at some chosen point,
and there is nothing wrong with this boundary condition, but neither
does it correspond to anything physically observable.

The topographical map in figure \figref{topo} suggests a good
way to visualize the relationship between field and potential
in two dimensions. Each contour on the map is a line of
constant height; some of these are labeled with their
elevations in units of feet. Height is related to gravitational
energy, so in a gravitational analogy, we can
think of height as representing potential. Where the contour
lines are far apart, as in the town, the slope is gentle.
Lines close together indicate a steep slope.

If we walk along a straight line, say straight east from the
town, then height (potential) is a function of the east-west
coordinate $x$. The slope along such a line is
$\der \phi/\der x$ (the rise over the run), and the electric
field is minus this derivative.

What if everything isn't confined to a straight line? Water
flows downhill. Notice how the streams on the map cut
perpendicularly through the lines of constant height.

It is possible to map potentials in the same way, as shown in
figure \figref{voltageofpointcharge}. Each curve is a line of constant
potential, called an equipotential. In the full three-dimensional representation,
the equipotentials would be surfaces. Moving along an equipotential is like
walking along a hillside without moving up or down. The electric field is strongest where the
equipotentials are closest together, and the
electric field vectors always point perpendicular to the
equipotentials. Figure \figref{dipole-equipotentials} shows a representation in this style
for the field of a dipole, overlaid with the field lines.

The one-dimensional relationship $E=-\der \phi/\der x$ generalizes
to three dimensions as follows: 
\begin{align*}
  E_x  &=  -\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}  \\
  E_y  &=  -\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y}  \\
  E_z  &=  -\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z}  
\end{align*}
This can be notated using the symbol $\nabla$, called the gradient operator,
\begin{equation*}
  \vc{E} = -\nabla \phi.
\end{equation*}

If a charge is located at the surface of a conductor, then moving it by an infinitesimal distance
in any direction parallel to the surface leaves it at the same potential, so that no work is
done by the electric field. Therefore the electric field never has any component parallel to
the surface of a conductor.

A common type of problem in electrostatics is that one is given boundary conditions in which
the potential is specified at certain conductors.

A car's radio antenna is usually in the form of a whip sticking up above its metal roof.
This is an example involving radio waves, which are time-varying electric and magnetic fields,
but a similar, simpler electrostatic example is the following. Suppose that we position a charge $q>0$
at a distance $\ell$ from a conducting plane. What is the resulting electric field? The conductor has
charges that are free to move, and due to the field of the charge $q$, we will end up with a
net concentration of negative charge in the part of the plane near $q$. The field in the vacuum surrounding
$q$ will be a sum of fields due to $q$ and fields due to these charges in the conducting plane.
The problem can be stated as that of finding a solution to Poisson's equation with the boundary
condition that $V=0$ at the conducting plane. Figure \subfigref{method-of-images}{1} shows the
kind of field lines we expect.

This looks like a very complicated problem, but there is trick that allows us to find
a simple solution. We can convert the problem into an equivalent one in which the conductor
isn't present, but a fictitious \emph{image} charge $-q$ is placed at an equal distance behind
the plane, like a reflection in a mirror, as in figure
\subfigref{method-of-images}{2}. The field is then simply the sum of the fields of the
charges $q$ and $-q$, so we can either add the field vectors or add the potentials. By symmetry, the
field lines are perpendicular to the plane, so the plane is an surface of constant potential, as required.

\notetext{curl-component-form}{The curl operator in terms of the field's components}
\notesummary{Fixing a Cartesian coordinate system, we find how to express the curl's components in terms
of the derivatives of the field's components with respect to the coordinates.}
Because we want the curl to be a kind of first derivative operator, we expect it to depend
only on the derivatives of the field's components with respect to the coordinates. 
The field has three components, and there are three coordinates that we can differentiate
with respect to, so there are nine possible partial derivatives that could consider.
Because the curl is intended to be a kind of derivative, and derivatives are additive,
we can isolate these partial derivatives from each other and add them. E.g., it's
conceivable (although not true, as we'll see shortly) that the $y$ component of the
curl is $3\partial E_x/\partial x-7\partial E_y/\partial z$, but we don't have to
consider possibilities such as $\sin(\partial E_y/\partial x)$.

The partial derivative $\partial E_x/\partial x$ contributes to the
divergence, but it can't contribute to the curl because of symmetry.
For example, in the field $x\hat{\vc{x}}$, this is the only partial
derivative that would be nonzero, but by symmetry the curl-meter won't
rotate when placed in this field. By rotational invariance, we can
immediately conclude that there is no contribution from the other
``self'' terms, $\partial E_y/\partial y$ and $\partial E_z/\partial z$.

Visualizing the field $y\hat{\vc{z}}$ with a curl-meter and applying the
right-hand rule, we can tell that its curl must have a positive $x$ component.
Up until now we have never specified the units of the curl-meter, but
now we need to decide. We define the curl so that the result in this case
is $+1$, so that $\partial E_z/\partial y$ occurs in the expression for the
$x$ component of the curl. Similar reasoning produces the term $-\partial E_y/\partial z$.

    'cyclicperm',

The remainder of the result follows from rotational invariance.
It is possible to take the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes and rotate them rigidly
in the manner shown in the figure, called a cyclic permutation. Therefore
if a derivative like $\partial E_z/\partial y$ occurs in the $x$ component of
the curl, then we must have the others obtained from it by cyclic permutation,
such as $\partial E_x/\partial z$ in the $y$ component. The result is:

\begin{align*}
                (\operatorname{curl}\,\vc{E})_x &= \frac{\partial E_z}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial E_y}{\partial z} \\ 
                (\operatorname{curl}\,\vc{E})_y &= \frac{\partial E_x}{\partial z}-\frac{\partial E_z}{\partial x}  \\ 
                (\operatorname{curl}\,\vc{E})_z &= \frac{\partial E_y}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial E_x}{\partial y}.
\end{align*}


\notetext{no-charge-on-interior}{No charge on the interior of a conductor}
\notesummary{For a conductor in equilibrium, any charge is on its surface, never in its interior.}
The proof of this assertion is essentially Earnshaw's theorem (example \ref{eg:earnshaw-theorem},
p.~\pageref{eg:earnshaw-theorem}).
Suppose that a charge $q$ in the conductor. For concreteness, let's say $q$ is positive.
By assumption, this charge is in a stable equilibrium.
If the charge is at the surface, then this equilibrium can be created by
both (1) the electric field, and (2) the force that keeps charges from getting out
through the surface. But if the charge is in the interior, then only electrical
forces can be involved, not other forces of type 2; this is essentially what we mean
by saying that the substance is a conductor. The electric field acting on $q$ would be
the field contributed by all the other charges, not by $q$ itself
(\notewithoutbackref{self-force}). But now everything plays out as in the original
argument proving Earnshaw's theorem: a stable equilibrium would require $\operatorname{div}\vc{E}<0$,
Gauss's law forbids this negative divergence from being created by external sources.

Figure \figref{e-field-lab-schematic} shows a circuit diagram of the apparatus. The
power supply provides an 8 V potential difference between the two metal
electrodes, drawn in black.  A voltmeter measures the potential
difference between an arbitrary reference voltage and a point of
interest in the gray area around the electrodes. The result will be
somewhere between 0 and 8 V.

The photo in figure \figref{e-field-lab-photo} shows the actual apparatus. The electrodes are painted with
silver paint on a detachable board, which goes underneath the big
board. What you actually see on top is just a piece of paper on which
you'll trace the equipotentials with a pen. The voltmeter is connected
to a U-shaped probe with a metal contact that slides underneath the
board, and a hole in the top piece for your pen. 

Turn your large board upside down. Find the small detachable board
with the parallel-plate capacitor pattern on it, and screw it to the underside of the
equipotential board, with the silver-painted side facing down toward
the tabletop. Use the washers to protect the silver paint so that it
doesn't get scraped off when you tighten the screws. Now connect the
voltage source (using the provided wires) to the two large screws on
either side of the board. Connect the multimeter so that you can
measure the voltage difference across the terminals of the voltage
source. Adjust the voltage source to give 8 volts. 

If you press down on the board, you can slip the paper
between the board and the four buttons you see at the
corners of the board. Tape the paper to your board, because the buttons aren't
very dependable. There are plastic stencils in some of the envelopes,
and you can use these to draw the electrodes accurately onto your paper
so you know where they are. The photo, for example, shows a pattern
with two point charges
traced onto the paper.

Each group will be assigned to trace one equipotential curve. Let's
say yours is 1.0 V.
Now put the U-probe in place so that
the top is above the equipotential board and the bottom of
it is below the board. You will first be looking for places
on the pattern board where the voltage is one volt --- look
for places where the meter reads 1.0 and mark them through
the hole on the top of your U-probe with a pencil or pen.
You should find a whole bunch of places there the voltage
equals one volt, so that you can draw a nice constant-voltage
curve connecting them. (If the line goes very far or curves
strangely, you may have to do more.) 

If you're using the PRO-100 meters, they will try to outsmart you by automatically
choosing a range. Most people find this annoying. To defeat this misfeature,
press the RANGE button, and you'll see the AUTO indicator on the screen turn off.
