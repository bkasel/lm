In sec.~\ref{sec:gauss-global}, p.~\pageref{sec:gauss-global}, we introduced the concept of
flux, which we defined using a surface integral. We have avoided up until now
any development of the toolbox of techniques that are needed in order to evaluate nontrivial
surface integrals, restricting ourselves to cases like example \ref{eg:flux-above-new-york},
p.~\pageref{eg:flux-above-new-york}, in which the integral could be broken down into a few
pieces, and the integrand was a constant for each piece. In this optional chapter, we describe
the main technique for explicitly evaluating a surface integral, which is to rewrite it as
two plain old integrals, one nested inside the other like Russian dolls. These are called
iterated integrals, and they have other applications besides the calculation of fluxes.
We will also look at some of these other applications as they apply to electricity and magnetism.
Knowledge of this material is not assumed later in the book.

A kindergarten teacher in Chicago is letting her kids out onto the
snowy playground for recess. One little boy is wearing a nice red wool cardigan,
but he doesn't know how to button it up. Mrs.~Kidlove uses the following algorithm
to button it up for him:

\begin{listing}{1}
For each button,
  push the button through the hole.
\end{listing}

This method of describing an algorithm is called pseudocode, because
unlike actual programming code, it's written in a format meant to be
read by humans. Line 1 introduces a repetitive action, known in
programming as a ``loop,'' because after performing the action in line 2,
we come back and do it again. Line 2 is the body of the loop --- the
thing that we're going to do over and over --- and it's indented to
show this. The effect is like modern poetry, but not as pretentious. 

\pagebreak

But wait, now Mrs.~Kidlove realizes it's not just this one kid. Red
wool cardigans are in style this year, and every little kid needs to
be buttoned up before going out. Now her algorithm looks like this:

\begin{listing}{1}
For each kid,
  for each button,
    push the button through the hole.
\end{listing}

To see how all this relates to surface integrals, let's consider the steps that would
have been required in order to knit one of those sweaters by hand. For those unfamiliar
with knitting, figure \figref{knitting} shows the idea:

%>
<% end_marg %>

\begin{listing}{1}
For each row,
  for each stitch,
    do certain things with the knitting needles.
\end{listing}

\noindent We're now going systematically through all the locations in
a surface, as in minilab \ref{lab:gauss-law}
(fig.~\figref{gauss-law-lab3}), where we measured the flux through the
top of the box:

\begin{listing}{1}
For each row,
  for each column,
    add the flux through the square to the total flux.
\end{listing}

This is still a discrete sum rather than an integral, but it clearly
can be used to approximate an integral. As an example involving a
discrete sum that we can write in mathematical notation, consider
the following puzzle (figure \figref{a-corner-in-wheat}) posed by Sam Loyd, who was known around 1900 as
the ``prince of puzzlers.''

\begin{quote}
According to encyclopediacal lore, the royal game, or what is now known as
chess, was invented by \ldots Sessa, and the king of [the Gupta Empire],
Shevan the Great, asked Sessa what reward he demanded for his wonderful
game. Sessa astonished the king by the apparent moderation of his demand, viz.,
one grain of wheat for the first square of the chess-board, two for the second,
four for the third, eight for the fourth, and so on, always doubling for each
square up to the sixty-fourth square of the chess board.
\end{quote}

This sum can be written as
\begin{equation*}
  \sum_{i=0}^7 \sum_{j=0}^7 2^{8i+j}.
\end{equation*}
Actually the two-dimensional nature of this sum is not really crucial to
the statement or solution of the puzzle, but it's picturesque and illustrates
the ideas and notation. The idea here is that we number the rows from 0 to 7,
and also the columns. Going across row $i=0$, the terms in the sum go
$2^0+\ldots+2^7$ as the column runs from $j=0$ to $j=7$. Then in row $i=1$ we have
$2^8+\ldots+2^{15}$, and so on for $i$ running up to $7$. Loyd doesn't explicitly
state what the reader is supposed to do in order to solve the puzzle, and figuring
out the right trick isn't relevant to your study of electricity and magnetism, but
if you enjoy this sort of thing:

<% self_check('a-corner-in-wheat',<<-'SELF_CHECK'
Simplify the sum and then approximate it in your head using scientific notation. (You will find
it useful that $10^{10}=1024\approx 10^3$, ``one k.'')
  SELF_CHECK
  ) %>

Although this puzzle can be fun to solve, the point here is really to introduce some
concepts and notation, using discrete sums as a warm-up for integrals. The sums $\sum$ are
like integrals $\int$, and the symbols $i$ and $j$ are like variables of integration
such as $\der x$ and $\der y$. In both cases, the variables are ``bound.'' That is,
in an expression like $\sum_{i}\ldots$, the symbol $i$ only has meaning \emph{inside} the
sum, and similarly in an integral $\int\ldots \der x$, $x$ doesn't mean anything outside
the integral.

The continuous version of the sum in the Loyd puzzle would be
\begin{equation*}
  \int_{y=0}^8 \left( \int_{x=0}^8 2^{8x+y } \der x\right) \der y.
\end{equation*}
We have an ``integral sandwich.''
Usually no ambiguity results if we simplify the notation a little:
\begin{equation*}
  \int_0^7 \int_0^7 2^{8x+y } \der x \der y.
\end{equation*}
This turns out to be of about the same order of magnitude as the discrete sum.
% Is actually about 1/8 as big:
% maxima -q --batch-string="1/float(integrate(integrate(2^(8*x+y),x,0,7),y,0,7)/(2^64-1));"

  fig(
    'e-to-x-plus-y',
    %q{The function $e^{x+y}$.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

To make this a little easier to visualize and work with, let's change it to the following:
\begin{equation*}
  \int_0^1 \left( \int_0^1 e^{x+y } \der x \right) \der y.
\end{equation*}
Just as an ordinary
integral is the area under a curve, this iterated integral can be interpreted as
the volume under the surface in figure \figref{e-to-x-plus-y}. We can handle this computation
just by applying some algebra and the familiar methods of integration. First let's
break up the exponential into two factors:
\begin{equation*}
  \int_0^1 \left( \int_0^1 e^x e^y \der x \right) \der y.
\end{equation*}
The advantage of doing this is that as far as the inside integral is concerned,
$x$ is the variable of integration, and $y$ is just a constant. Then we can
do as we are always allowed in integration and take the constant factor outside:
\begin{equation*}
  \int_0^1 \left( e^y \int_0^1 e^x \der x \right) \der y.
\end{equation*}
Now the innermost integral is just an ordinary one-dimensional integral,
which we can evaluate as $\left.e^x\right|_0^1=e-1$. We then have
\begin{align*}
  &\int_0^1 \left( e^y (e-1) \right) \der y \\
       &\qquad = (e-1) \int_0^1 e^y \der y \\
       &\qquad = (e-1)^2 \\
       &\qquad \approx 2.95.
\end{align*}
As a check to see that this is reasonable, the solid in the figure has a base that is
$1\times1$ in area, so its volume should be equal to $1\times1$ multiplied by the average
value of the function within this square. The function varies from $e^{0+0}=1$ at the lower
corner to $e^{1+1}\approx 7.4$ at the top of the ski jump, so it's pretty plausible that
its average value is 2.95.

<% end_sec('iterated-integrals') %>


<% begin_sec("Varying limits of integration",nil,'varying-limits') %>
One way to express the number of squares on a chess board is
\begin{equation*}
  \sum_{i=0}^7\sum_{j=0}^7 1 = 64,
\end{equation*}
represented visually by figure \subfigref{summing-dots}{1}.
This is the world's silliest way to notate the type of standard grade-school
arithmetic problem in which Sally has 8 skirts and 8 tops, and we want to
know how many outfits she can put together.

<% marg() %>
<%   
  fig(
    'summing-dots',
    %q{Summing dots.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

Suppose, on the other hand, that Sally has 8 dogs, and she wants to pick two
to take on a walk. Then the sum becomes
\begin{equation*}
  \sum_{i=0}^7\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} 1 = 28,
\end{equation*}
figure \subfigref{summing-dots}{2}. The restriction on the inner sum prevents
double counting, since, e.g., taking Daisy and Lucy on a walk is the same
as taking Lucy and Daisy. We've come across sums of this form previously,
in example \ref{eg:chlorine-pentafluoride}, p.~\pageref{eg:chlorine-pentafluoride}, where
we found the electrical energy of a molecule containing 6 atoms. With a 1 inside the sum,
as in the present examples, we got the number of combinations of atoms that needed to
be considered, while with an energy inside the sum we got the total energy.

In the second example, note how the upper limit of of the inner sum depends on the
summation variable $i$ used in the outer sum. This makes sense, because $i$ is
a bound variable that does mean something inside the outer sum. On the other hand,
it would not make sense to write a sum like $\sum_{i=0}^{j-1}\sum_{j=0}^7$, because
the upper limit $j-1$ contains the symbol. In the example of the teacher buttoning
the kids' sweaters, a similar nonsensical example would be
\begin{listing}{1}
For each button on that kid's sweater,
  for each kid,
    push the button through the hole.
\end{listing}
If you show this sentence to someone, they'll get confused because there is no
``that kid'' at the outermost level.

All of these ideas apply to integrals as well. If the limits of integration
are constant and finite, then an integral of the form $\int_a^b\int_c^d\ldots$
can only be an integral over a rectangle. But if we relax this restriction,
then we can, for example, find the area of a triangle:
\begin{align*}
  \int_0^1\int_0^y \der x\der y &= \int_0^1 y \der y \\
            &= \frac{1}{2}.
\end{align*}

Often we want to do a change of variable (``$u$ substitution), and this works
out pretty much the same for iterated integrals as for ordinary integrals,
including the need to change the differential and the limits of integration.

\begin{eg}{Area of a right triangle}
Let a right triangle have legs $a$ and $b$. We want to find its area.
As a preliminary, we set up a coordinate system with side $a$ along the
$x$ axis and the hypotenuse described as the line $y=(b/a)x$.
The setup looks like this.
\begin{align*}
  \int_0^a \int_0^{bx/a} \der y \der x
\end{align*}
Notice how we had to make the $y$ integral the inside part of the sandwich
and $x$ the outside part. If we hadn't done this, then we would have
had to fiddle with things to keep from ungrammatically referring to the
inner integral's variable in the outer integral's limits of integration.
In examples like these, it's almost always advantageous to do a change of
variables, if possible, such that the new variables are unitless. Here,
the natural way to accomplish that is to define $u=x/a$ and $v=y/b$.
We then have $\der y \der x=ab\der v\der u$ and for the upper limit
of integration on the inside integral, $v=y/b=(bx/a)/b=x/a=u$. Taking
the constant factor $ab$ outside, we then have
\begin{align*}
  ab \int_0^1 \int_0^u \der v \der u.
\end{align*}
This is a big win, because the double integral is now a true definite
integral, with no adjustable parameters like $a$ or $b$. In fact,
we've already evaluated this integral (with different names for the
bound variables, which is irrelevant) and found it to be $1/2$, so
the result is $ab/2$, as expected.
\end{eg}

<% begin_sec("How to set up applications",nil,'iterated-setup') %>
Up until now we've been doing a lot of integrals where the thing inside the
integral is just 1. But in real-world applications we usually have something
we're integrating. Here are some typical applications from mechanics, in which
we integrate over space:

\begin{tabular}{p{50mm}p{50mm}}
\emph{thing being integrated} & \emph{integral} \\
density                       & mass \\
density $\times r^2$          & moment of inertia
\end{tabular}

\noindent In electricity and magnetism:

\begin{tabular}{p{50mm}p{50mm}}
\emph{thing being integrated} & \emph{integral} \\
charge density                & charge \\
energy density                & energy \\
momentum density              & momentum \\
charge density $\times z$     & dipole moment along the $z$ axis
\end{tabular}

Any of these can exist in one dimension ($\int$), two ($\int\int$), or three ($\int\int\int$).
The following two examples from mechanics
illustrate the typical setup process in a one-dimensional case.

\begin{eg}{Mass of an air column}
\egquestion
Above some small area on the surface of the earth, we have an air column
with mass per unit height (i.e., linear density) $\der m/\der z = Ae^{-az}$, where $a$ is a
positive constant $A$ tells us how thick the atmosphere is at sea level.
Find the total mass in this air column.

\eganswer The general idea is simply to start by saying that the integral is
the sum of a whole bunch of little tiny parts:
\begin{equation*}
  \int \der m.
\end{equation*}
If you're not experienced with this sort of thing, it might never occur to you
to you to write this down, because $m$ isn't a variable, and nothing is
a function of $m$. That's OK. Here $\der m$ just means ``a little bit of
mass,'' and $\int$ means ``add upp all the\ldots'' But in order to evaluate
the integral, we now have to substitute:
\begin{align*}
  \int \der m &= \int \frac{\der m}{\der z} \der z \\
              &= \int_0^\infty Ae^{-az} \der z \\
              &= \frac{A}{a}.
\end{align*}
This makes sense, because the units come out right ($(\kgunit/\munit)/\munit^{-1}$),
and the the dependence on $A$ and $a$ is right (e.g., smaller $a$ means the density falls
off more slowly with height, which should give a bigger total mass).
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Moment of inertia of a rod}
\egquestion Find the moment of inertia of a uniform rod for rotation about one end.

\eganswer Let the rod's total mass be $M$ and its length $\ell$.
The moment of inertia $I$ is
\begin{align*}
  I &= \int \der I \\
    &= \int r^2 \der m .
\end{align*}
Because the rod is uniform, $\der m/\der r = M/\ell$, and $\der m = (M/\ell)\der r$.
\begin{align*}
  I &= \int_0^\ell r^2 \frac{M}{\ell} \der r \\
    &= \frac{M}{\ell} \int_0^\ell r^2 \der r
\end{align*}
It's nicer to change to the unitless variable $u=r/\ell$, which gives
\begin{align*}
  I &= \frac{M}{\ell}\ell^3 \int_0^1 u^2 \der u \\
    &= \frac{1}{3}M\ell^2.
\end{align*}
\end{eg}

Here's an example involving electromagnetism and three dimensions.

\begin{eg}{Energy of an electromagnetic wave}
\egquestion Find the average energy density of a sinusoidal electromagnetic plane wave, within
a rectangular box oriented so that its axes coincide with $\vc{E}$, $\vc{B}$, and $\vc{S}$.
Let the box encompass an integer number of wavelengths.

\eganswer
Using the expressions for the energy densities of the fields, and the fact that $Bc=E$, we
have
\begin{align*}
  U &= \int \der U \\
    &= \int \frac{1}{4\pi k}E^2 \der v \\
    &= \frac{1}{4\pi k} \int E^2 \der v.
\end{align*}
Let the $z$ axis be the direction of propagation, and let $x$ and $y$ be aligned with the
other edges of the box. Let $k=2\pi/\lambda$. Then
\begin{align*}
  U &= \frac{1}{4\pi k} \int E^2 \der x\der y\der z \\
    &= \frac{1}{4\pi k} \int \int \int \mytilde{E}^2 \sin^2 kz \der x\der y\der z \\
    &= \frac{\mytilde{E}^2}{4\pi k} \int \int \int \sin^2 kz \der x\der y\der z .
\end{align*}
The integrand doesn't depend on $x$ or $y$, so
\begin{align*}
  U &= \frac{\mytilde{E}^2}{4\pi k} \int \sin^2 kz \left(\int \int \der x\der y\right)\der z \\
    &= \frac{\mytilde{E}^2A}{4\pi k} \int \sin^2 kz \der z ,
\end{align*}
where $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the box in the plane perpendicular to propagation.
Because the remaining $z$ integral covers an integer number of wavelengths, its average value is
$1/2$, and we can replace it with $1/2$. This fact becomes obvious if you graph the function
$\sin^2$, or if you consider that $\sin^2+\cos^2=1$. The $z$ integral therefore equals $1/2$ times
the length of the box. Grouping these factors together with $A$, we get $V/2$, half the volume.
The result for the total energy is $  U = \mytilde{E}^2V/8\pi k$, which gives the
average energy density
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{U}{V} = \frac{\mytilde{E}^2}{8\pi k}.
\end{equation*}
In other words, the electric and magnetic fields have equal energy densities, their average
energy densities are equal to half their maximum values, and therefore the average total
energy density is equal to the maximum energy density of the electric field.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Energy of a line of charge}
\egquestion Find the electrical potential energy of a uniform line of charge
of finite length.

\eganswer The total electrical potential energy is
\begin{equation*}
  U = \int \der U = \frac{1}{2} \int\int \frac{k\der q_1\der q_2}{r},
\end{equation*}
where the factor of 1/2 is to undo the effect of double-counting. Let the density of
charge be $\lambda=\der q/\der x$, and let the line go from $x=0$ to $\ell$. Then
\begin{align*}
  U &= \frac{1}{2} k\lambda^2 \int_{x_1=0}^\ell \int_{x_2=0}^\ell \frac{\der x_1\der x_2}{|x_1-x_2|}\\
    &= k\lambda^2 \int_{x_1=0}^\ell \int_{x_2=0}^{x_1} \frac{\der x_1\der x_2}{x_1-x_2} .
\end{align*}
In the second line, we've changed the limits of integration so that we only integrate over combinations
of points with $x_2<x_1$. This means we get rid of the $1/2$, and we don't need the absolute value
in the denominator anymore. Evaluating the inside integral gives
\begin{align*}
  U &= -k\lambda^2 \int_{x_1=0}^\ell \left.\ln(x_1-x_2)\right|_0^{x_1}\der x_2.
\end{align*}
Plugging in the limits of integration gives a divergence at $x_2=x_1$, so the result is that
the energy is $+\infty$. In other words, if we wanted to bring charges from far away and assemble
them into this configuration, it would require an infinite amount of mechanical work.

The electric
field made by a continuous charge distribution is the
sum of the fields created by every part of it. If we let the
``parts'' become infinitesimally small, we have a sum of an
infinitely many infinitesimal numbers: an
integral.

\begin{eg}{Field of a uniformly charged rod}\label{eg:chargedrod}
\egquestion
A rod of length $L$ has charge $Q$ spread
uniformly along it. Find the electric field at a point a
distance $d$ from the center of the rod, along the rod's axis.

\eganswer
This is a one-dimensional
situation, so we really only need to do a single integral
representing the total field along the axis. We imagine
breaking the rod down into short pieces of length $\der  z$, each
with charge $\der  q$. Since charge is uniformly spread along the
rod, we have $\der  q=\lambda\der  z$, where $\lambda= Q/ L$ (Greek lambda) is the
charge per unit length, in units of coulombs per meter. Since the pieces are infinitesimally
short, we can treat them as point charges and use the
expression $k\der  q/ r^2$ for their contributions to the field,
where $r= d- z$ is the distance from the charge at $z$ to the
point in which we are interested.
\begin{align*}
                 E_{z}         &=  \int \frac{ k\der  q }{ r^2}   \\
                         &=  \int_{- L/2}^{+ L/2} \frac{ k\lambda\der  z }{ r^2}   \\
                         &=   k \lambda \int_{- L/2}^{+ L/2} \frac{\der  z}{( d- z)^2}
\end{align*}
The integral can be looked up in a table, or reduced to an
elementary form by substituting a new variable for
$d- z$. The result is
\begin{align*}
                 E_{z}         &=    k\lambda\left(\frac{1}{ d- z}\right)_{- L/2}^{+ L/2}   \\
                         &=   \frac{ kQ}{ L} \left(\frac{1}{ d- L/2}-\frac{1}{ d+ L/2}\right)\eqquad.  
\end{align*}
        For large values of $d$, this expression gets
smaller for two reasons: (1) the denominators of the
fractions become large, and (2) the two fractions become
nearly the same, and tend to cancel out. This makes sense,
since the field should get weaker as we get farther away from
the charge. In fact, the field at large distances must approach
$ kQ/ d^2$ (homework problem \ref{hw:distantrsquared}).

It's also interesting to note that the field becomes
infinite at the ends of the rod, but is not infinite on the
interior of the rod. Can you explain physically why this happens?
\end{eg}

Example \ref{eg:chargedrod} was one-dimensional. In the general three-dimensional
case, we might have to integrate all three components of the field. However,
there is a trick that lets us avoid this much complication. The potential is a scalar,
so we can find the potential by doing just a single integral, then use the potential
to find the field.

\begin{eg}{Potential, then field}\label{eg:chargedrodside}
\egquestion
A rod of length $L$ is uniformly charged with charge $Q$.
Find the field at a point lying in the midplane of the rod
at a distance $R$. 

\eganswer
By symmetry, the field has only a radial component, $E_R$, pointing
directly away from the rod (or toward it for $Q<0$). The brute-force approach,
then, would be to evaluate the integral $E=\int |\der\vc{E}|\zu{cos}\ \theta$,
where $\der\vc{E}$ is the contribution to the field from a charge $\der q$ at some
point along the rod, and $\theta$ is the angle $\der\vc{E}$ makes with the radial line.

It's easier, however, to find the potential first, and then find the field from the
potential. Since the potential is a scalar,
we simply integrate the contribution $\der V$ from each charge $\der q$, without
even worrying about angles and directions. Let $z$ be the coordinate that measures distance
up and down along the rod, with $z=0$ at the center of the rod. Then the distance
between a point $z$ on the rod and the point of interest is 
$r=\sqrt{ z^2+ R^2}$, and we have
\begin{align*}
         V        &= \int \frac{ k\der q}{ r} \\
                        &=  k\lambda \int_{- L/2}^{+ L/2}\frac{\der z}{ r} \\
                        &=  k\lambda \int_{- L/2}^{+ L/2}\frac{\der z}{\sqrt{ z^2+ R^2}} \\
\end{align*}
The integral can be looked up in a table, or evaluated using computer software:
\begin{align*}
         V        &= \left. k\lambda\: \zu{ln}\left( z+\sqrt{ z^2+ R^2}\right)\right|_{- L/2}^{+ L/2} \\
                &=  k\lambda\: \zu{ln}\left(%
                                        \frac{ L/2+\sqrt{ L^2/4+ R^2}}%
                                                {- L/2+\sqrt{ L^2/4+ R^2}}%
                                \right) \\
\end{align*}
The expression inside the parentheses can be simplified a little.
Leaving out some tedious algebra, the result is
\begin{equation*}
         V = 2 k\lambda\: \zu{ln}\left(%
                                        \frac{ L}{2 R}%
                                                +\sqrt{1+\frac{ L^2}{4 R^2}}%
                                \right)
\end{equation*}

This can readily be differentiated to find the field:
\begin{align*}
         E_{R}        &= -\frac{\der V}{\der R} \\
                                        &= (-2 k\lambda)%
                                                \frac{%
                                                        - L/2 R^2
                                                        +(1/2)(1+ L^2/4 R^2)^{-1/2}(- L^2/2 R^3)
                                                }{%
                                                         L/2 R+(1+ L^2/4 R^2)^{1/2}
                                                }\eqquad, \qquad \\
\intertext{or, after some simplification,}
                 E_{R} &= \frac{ k\lambda L}{ R^2\sqrt{1+ L^2/4 R^2}}
\end{align*}

For large values of $R$, the square root approaches one, and we have
simply $E_{R}\approx k\lambda L/ R^2= k Q/ R^2$.
In other words, the field very far away is the same regardless of whether the charge
is a point charge or some other shape like a rod. This is intuitively appealing, and
doing this kind of check also helps to reassure one that the final result is correct.
\end{eg}
The preceding example, although it involved some messy algebra, required only straightforward
calculus, and no vector operations at all, because we only had to integrate a scalar
function to find the potential. The next example is one in which
we can integrate either the field or the potential without too much complication.

\begin{eg}{On-axis field of a ring of charge}\label{eg:ring}
        \egquestion
        Find the potential and field along the axis of a uniformly charged ring.

        \eganswer
        Integrating the potential is straightforward.
        \begin{align*}
                 V        &= \int \frac{ k\der q}{ r} \\
                                &=  k \int \frac{\der q}{\sqrt{ b^2+ z^2}} \\
                                &= \frac{ k}{\sqrt{ b^2+ z^2}} \int \der q \\
                                &= \frac{ kQ}{\sqrt{ b^2+ z^2}}\eqquad,
        \end{align*}
        where $Q$ is the total charge of the ring.
        This result could have been derived without calculus, since the distance
        $r$ is the same for every point around the ring, i.e., the integrand is a constant.
        It would also be straightforward to find the field by differentiating this expression
        with respect to $z$ (homework problem \ref{hw:ringve}).

        Instead, let's see how to find the field by direct integration. By symmetry, the
        field at the point of interest can have only a component along the axis of
        symmetry, the $z$ axis:
        \begin{align*}
                 E_{x}        &= 0 \\
                 E_y        &= 0 
        \end{align*}
        To find the field in the $z$ direction, we integrate the $z$ components
        contributed to the field by each infinitesimal part of the ring.
        \begin{align*}
                 E_{z}        &= \int \der E_z \\
                                                &= \int |\der\vc{E}|\:\zu{cos}\:\theta\eqquad,
        \end{align*}
        where $\theta$ is the angle shown in the figure.
        \begin{align*}
                 E_{z}        &= \int \frac{ k\der q}{ r^2}\:\zu{cos}\:\theta \\
                                                &=  k \int \frac{\der q}{ b^2+ z^2}\:\zu{cos}\:\theta 
        \end{align*}
        Everything inside the integral is a constant, so we have
        \begin{align*}
                 E_{z}        &= \frac{ k}{ b^2+ z^2}\:\zu{cos}\:\theta \int \der q \\
                                                &= \frac{ kQ}{ b^2+ z^2}\:\zu{cos}\:\theta \\
                                                &= \frac{ kQ}{ b^2+ z^2}\:\frac{ z}{ r} \\
                                                &= \frac{ kQz}{\left( b^2+ z^2\right)^\zu{3/2}} 
        \end{align*}
\end{eg}

In all the examples presented so far, the charge has been confined to a one-dimensional
line or curve. Although it is possible, for example, to put charge on a piece of wire,
it is more common to encounter practical devices in which the charge is distributed
over a two-dimensional surface, as in the flat metal plates used in Thomson's experiments.
Mathematically, we can approach this type of calculation with the divide-and-conquer
technique: slice the surface into lines or curves whose fields we know how to calculate,
and then add up the contributions to the field from all these slices. In the limit where the
slices are imagined to be infinitesimally thin, we have an integral.

\begin{eg}{Field of a uniformly charged disk}\label{eg:diskofcharge}
\egquestion
A circular disk is uniformly charged. (The disk must be an insulator; if it was a conductor,
then the repulsion of all the charge would cause it to collect more densely near the
edge.) Find the field at a point on the axis, at a distance $z$ from the plane of the disk.

%>
<% end_marg %>

\eganswer
We're given that every part of the disk has the same charge per unit area, so rather
than working with $Q$, the total charge, it will be easier to use the charge
per unit area, conventionally notated $\sigma$ (Greek sigma), $\sigma= Q/\pi b^2$.

Since we already know the field due to a ring of charge, we can solve the problem
by slicing the disk into rings, with each ring extending from $r$ to $r+\der r$.
The area of such a ring equals its circumference multiplied by its width,
i.e., $2\pi r\der r$, so its charge is $\der q=2\pi\sigma r\der r$,
and from the result of example \ref{eg:ring}, its contribution to the field is
\begin{align*}
        \der E_{z}        &= \frac{ kz\der q}{\left( r^2+ z^2\right)^\zu{3/2}} \\
                                        &= \frac{2\pi\sigma kzr\der r}{\left( r^2+ z^2\right)^\zu{3/2}} \\
\end{align*}
The total field is
\begin{align*}
         E_{z}        &= \int \der E_{z} \\
                                        &= 2\pi\sigma kz
                                                \int_0^{b} 
                                                \frac{ r\der r}{\left( r^2+ z^2\right)^\zu{3/2}} \\
                &= 2\pi\sigma kz \left. %
                                \frac{-1}{\sqrt{ r^2+ z^2}}
                        \right|_{ r=0}^{ r=\zu{b}} \\
                &= 2\pi\sigma k\left(1-\frac{ z}{\sqrt{ b^2+ z^2}}\right)
\end{align*}
\end{eg}

The result of example \ref{eg:diskofcharge} has some interesting properties.
First, we note that it was derived on the unspoken assumption
of $z>0$. By symmetry, the field on the other side of the disk must be equally
strong, but in the opposite direction, as shown  in
figures \figref{diskfield} and \figref{diskfieldgraph}. Thus there is a discontinuity in the field
at $z=0$. In reality, the disk will have some finite thickness, and the switching
over of the field will be rapid, but not discontinuous.

At large values of $z$, i.e., $z\gg b$, the field rapidly approaches
the $1/r^2$ variation that we expect when we are so far from the disk that the disk's
size and shape cannot matter (homework problem \ref{hw:distantrsquared}).

    %q{The flux through a cylindrical circuit due to a line of charge.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>
In the most general case, the surface is not flat, and the field is nonuniform.
As an example, we take the setup shown in figure \subfigref{eg-line-charge-flux-through-cylinder}{1}.
There is a uniform, infinite line of charge with charge density $\lambda$, perpendicular to the
page. As our Gaussian surface, we take a cylinder of radius $a$ and finite height $H$,
whose axis is parallel to the line
of charge and lies at a distance $\ell$ from it. We expect the flux to be zero, since the charge
is outside the surface.

Figure \subfigref{eg-line-charge-flux-through-cylinder}{2} shows the setup for directly calculating
this flux. A certain point on the surface lies at a distance $r$ from the line of charge, and
the electric field at this point has magnitude $E=2k\lambda/r$, and the direction shown by the
arrow. We use cylindrical coordinates to describe the point: $z$ in the direction perpendicular to
the page, and an angle $\theta$. For infinitesimal changes $\der z$ and $\der\theta$ in the coordinates,
the area is $\der A=(\text{arc length})\der z=a\der\theta\der z$. We write $\varphi$ for
the angle between the area vector and the field. Then the flux is given by
\begin{align*}
  \Phi &= \int \vc{E}\cdot\der\vc{A} \\
       &= \int E\der A\cos\varphi \\
       &= 2ka\lambda \int_0^H \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\cos\varphi}{r} \der\theta\der z \\
       &= 2kaH\lambda \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\cos\varphi}{r} \der\theta . \\
\end{align*}
Since we expect to prove $\Phi$ is zero, let's drop the constant factors in front.
The law of cosines can be applied in two different ways here, as
$\ell^2 =a^2+r^2-2ar\cos\varphi$ and $r^2 = \ell^2+a^2+2a\ell\cos\theta$.
Using the first of these to eliminate $\cos\varphi$, we have for our integral
\begin{equation*}
  \Phi \quad =  \quad \int_0^{2\pi} \left(1-\frac{\ell^2-a^2}{r^2}\right) \der\theta .
\end{equation*}
Now using the second one to eliminate $r^2$, we obtain
\begin{equation*}
  \Phi \quad \propto \quad \int_0^{2\pi} \left(1-\frac{\ell^2-a^2}{\ell^2+a^2+2a\ell\cos\theta}\right) \der\theta.
\end{equation*}
The writing can be simplified by defining the dimensionless constant $c=a/\ell$, with $c<1$ because
the cylinder doesn't contain the charge, and it also turns out to be helpful to
let $\beta=2c/(1+c^2)$, which gives $\beta<1$.
Then
\begin{equation*}
  \Phi \quad \propto \quad 2\pi \enskip - \enskip \frac{1-c^2}{1+c^2}\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\der\theta}{1+\beta\cos\theta} .
\end{equation*}
I didn't know how to do this integral, so I resorted to computer software, which verified that the result
was indeed just right in order to cancel out the $2\pi$ term.
Later I learned that integrals of this form can be approached systematically by using a set of
rules called Bioche's rules. There is a Wikipedia article on the topic, including a sketch of how
to apply the rules to this example.
