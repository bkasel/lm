How can we put electric currents to work? Figure
\subfigref{basiccircuits-1}{1} shows an attempt to use static electricity
to light a lightbulb. We take two substances, e.g., glass and fur, rub
them together, and then touch them to wires connected to a lightbulb.
This method is unsatisfactory. True, current will flow through the
bulb, since electrons can move through metal wires, and the excess
electrons on the glass rod will therefore come through the wires and
bulb due to the attraction of the positively charged fur and the
repulsion of the other electrons. The problem is that after a
zillionth of a second of current, the rod and fur will both have run
out of charge. No more current will flow, and the lightbulb will go
out.

Figure \subfigref{basiccircuits-1}{2} shows a setup that works. The battery pushes
charge through the circuit, and recycles it over and over
again. (We will have more to say later in this chapter about
how batteries work.) This is called a \emph{\index{circuit!complete}\index{complete
circuit}complete \index{circuit}circuit}. Today, the
electrical use of the word ``circuit'' is the only one that
springs to mind for most people, but the original meaning
was to travel around and make a round trip, as when a
circuit court judge would ride around the boondocks,
dispensing justice in each town on a certain date.

Note that an example like \subfigref{basiccircuits-1}{3} does not work. The wire will
quickly begin acquiring a net charge, because it has no way
to get rid of the charge flowing into it. The repulsion of
this charge will make it more and more difficult to send any
more charge in, and soon the electrical forces exerted by
the battery will be canceled out completely. The whole
process would be over so quickly that the filament would not
even have enough time to get hot and glow. This is known as
an \index{circuit!open}\index{open circuit}\emph{open circuit}.
Exactly the same thing would happen if the complete circuit
of figure \subfigref{basiccircuits-1}{2} was cut somewhere with a pair of scissors, and
in fact that is essentially how an ordinary light switch
works: by opening up a gap in the circuit.

<% begin_sec("Measuring the current in a circuit",nil,'measuring-current') %>
The measurement of potential (voltage) differences was discussed in sec.~\ref{sec:potential},
p.~\pageref{sec:potential}.

On p.~\pageref{current-defined}, we defined electric current as the rate at which electric charge
flows across a boundary, $I=\der q/\der t$.
This definition has the theoretical advantage that when moving charges create
a magnetic field, the field is exactly proportional to the current, independent
of other variables such as the velocity of the charges.
Now that we are ready to study circuits in more detail, a second, practical
advantage of this definition becomes apparent, which is that current is
easy to measure compared to quantities like charge or the velocity of charges.
The instrument used to measure current is the
ammeter, introduced briefly on p.~\pageref{ammeter-intro}.
A simplified ammeter, \subfigref{basiccircuits-2}{1}, simply
consists of a coiled-wire magnet whose force twists an iron
needle against the resistance of a spring. The greater the
current, the greater the force. Although the construction of
ammeters may differ, their use is always the same. We break
into the path of the electric current and interpose the
meter like a tollbooth on a road, \subfigref{basiccircuits-2}{2}. There is still a
complete circuit, and as far as the battery and bulb are
concerned, the ammeter is just another segment of wire.

Does it matter where in the circuit we place the ammeter?
Could we, for instance, have put it in the left side of the
circuit instead of the right? Conservation of charge tells
us that this can make no difference. Charge is not destroyed
or ``used up'' by the lightbulb, so we will get the same
current reading on either side of it. What is ``used up'' is
energy stored in the battery, which is being converted into
heat and light energy.

<% end_marg %>

Figure \figref{ammeter-practical} shows a typical multimeter
used as an ammeter. As always with a multimeter, one cable is
plugged into the COM plug. The other cable is plugged into the
plug marked 10 A, meaning that it's used for current measurements
and can handle large currents, up to 10 A. The rotary dial is
turned to the corresponding A setting. The icons indicate that this
position of the dial can be used to measure either AC or DC current,
and the yellow button has been used to select DC, as verified
on the LCD readout. The lines connecting the two plugs that are in
use say ``FUSED,'' which means that if too much current flows, the
meter will avoid damaging itself by blowing a fuse. The meter's reading
of $4.572\ \zu{A}$ verifies that the amount of current being measured
is appropriate for this scale. If it had been more than 10 A, the
fuse would have blown, and the meter would be reading zero. If we were
intending to read a current smaller than 400 mA, then we would be better
off changing both the plug and the rotary dial to use the more sensitive
setting, which would give us better precision (more sig figs).

The following table summarizes some differences between the use of
a voltmeter (sec.~\ref{sec:potential},
p.~\pageref{sec:potential}) and an ammeter.

\begin{eg}{Magnetic levitation}\label{eg:battery-wire-magnet}
      In figure \figref{battery-wire-magnet}, a small, disk-shaped permanent magnet is stuck on the side of a
      battery, and a wire is clasped loosely around the battery, shorting it.
      A large current flows. The electrons moving through the
      wire feel a force from the magnetic field made by the permanent magnet,
      and this force levitates the wire.

      From the photo, it's possible to find the direction of the magnetic field made by the permanent magnet.
      The electrons in the copper wire are negatively charged, so they flow from the negative (flat) terminal
      of the battery to the positive terminal (the one with the bump, in front). As the electrons pass by the
      permanent magnet, we can imagine that they would experience a field either toward the magnet, or away from
      it, depending on which way the magnet was flipped when it was stuck onto the battery.
      If $q$ had been positive, then $q\vc{v}\times\vc{B}$ would have been in the direction of
      $\vc{v}\times\vc{B}$, determined by the right-hand rule. Since $q<0$ here, the right-hand
      rule flips its handedness, as shown in the bottom panel of the figure.
      The field must be toward the battery.

      This example is very similar to the design of the simplified ammeter in figure
      \subfigref{basiccircuits-2}{1}. The main difference is that the roles of the known
      and unknown quantities is reversed: we know something about the direction of the current,
      and we use it to find out about the unknown direction of the magnetic field of the permanent magnet.

Electrical circuits can be used for sending signals, storing
information, or doing calculations, but their most common
purpose by far is to manipulate energy, as in the battery-and-bulb
example of the previous section. We know that lightbulbs are
rated in units of watts, i.e., how many joules per second of
energy they can convert into heat and light, but how would
this relate to the flow of charge as measured in amperes? By
way of analogy, suppose your friend, who didn't take
physics, can't find any job better than pitching bales of
hay. The number of calories he burns per hour will certainly
depend on how many bales he pitches per minute, but it will
also be proportional to how much mechanical work he has to
do on each bale. If his job is to toss them up into a
hayloft, he will get tired a lot more quickly than someone
who merely tips bales off a loading dock into trucks. In metric units,
\begin{equation*}
        \frac{\text{joules}}{\text{second}}
         = \frac{\text{haybales}}{\text{second}}
                 \times \frac{\text{joules}}{\text{haybale}}\eqquad.  
\end{equation*}
Similarly, the rate of energy transformation by a battery
will not just depend on how many coulombs per second it
pushes through a circuit but also on how much mechanical
work it has to do on each coulomb of charge:
\begin{equation*}
        \frac{\text{joules}}{\text{second}}
         = \frac{\text{coulombs}}{\text{second}}
                 \times \frac{\text{joules}}{\text{coulomb}}
\end{equation*}
\noindent or
\begin{equation*}
        \text{power}         =         \text{current} \times \text{voltage}\eqquad.  
\end{equation*}
\begin{eg}{Units of volt-amps}
\egquestion
Doorbells are often rated in volt-amps. What does
this combination of units mean?

\eganswer
Current times voltage gives units of power,
$P= I\Delta  V$, so volt-amps are really just a nonstandard
way of writing watts. They are telling you how much power
the doorbell requires.

\end{eg}
\begin{eg}{Power dissipated by a battery and bulb}
\egquestion
If a 9.0-volt battery causes 1.0 A to flow through
a lightbulb, how much power is dissipated?

\eganswer
The voltage rating of a battery tells us what
voltage difference $\Delta  V$ it is designed to maintain
between its terminals.
\begin{align*}
         P         &=      I \ \Delta \zu{V}   \\
                 &=     9.0 \ \zu{A}\cdot\zu{V} \\
                 &=     9.0  \ \frac{\zu{C}}{\zu{s}}\cdot\frac{\zu{J}}{\zu{C}} \\
                 &=     9.0 \ \text{J/s}  \\
                 &=     9.0 \ \zu{W}  
\end{align*}

The only nontrivial thing in this problem was dealing with
the units. One quickly gets used to translating common
combinations like $\zu{A}\cdot\zu{V}$ into simpler terms.

So far we have simply presented it as an observed fact that
a battery-and-bulb circuit quickly settles down to a steady
flow, but why should it? Newton's second law, $a=F/m$, would
seem to predict that the steady forces on the charged
particles should make them whip around the circuit faster
and faster. The answer is that as charged particles move
through matter, there are always forces, analogous to
frictional forces, that resist the motion. These forces need
to be included in Newton's second law, which is really 
$a=F_{total}/m$, not  $a=F/m$.  If, by analogy, you push a
crate across the floor at constant speed, i.e., with zero
acceleration, the total force on it must be zero. After you
get the crate going, the floor's frictional force is exactly
canceling out your force. The chemical energy stored in your
body is being transformed into heat in the crate and the
floor, and no longer into an increase in the crate's kinetic
energy. Similarly, the battery's internal chemical energy is
converted into heat, not into perpetually increasing the
charged particles' kinetic energy. Changing energy into heat
may be a nuisance in some circuits, such as a computer chip,
but it is vital in an incandescent lightbulb, which must get hot enough to
glow. Whether we like it or not, this kind of heating effect
is going to occur any time charged particles move through matter.

What determines the amount of heating? One flashlight bulb
designed to work with a 9-volt battery might be labeled 1.0
watts, another 5.0. How does this work? Even without knowing
the details of this type of friction at the atomic level, we
can relate the heat dissipation to the amount of current
that flows via the equation $P=I\Delta $V. If the two
flashlight bulbs can have two different values of $P$ when
used with a battery that maintains the same $\Delta V$, it
must be that the 5.0-watt bulb allows five times more
current to flow through it.

For many substances, including the tungsten from which
lightbulb filaments are made, experiments show that the
amount of current that will flow through it is directly
proportional to the voltage difference placed across it. For
an object made of such a substance, we define its electrical
\index{resistance!defined}\emph{resistance} as follows:\index{Ohm, Georg Simon}

\begin{lessimportant}[definition of resistance]\index{resistance!defined}
If an object inserted in a circuit displays a current flow 
proportional to the voltage difference across it, then we define
its resistance as the constant ratio
        \begin{equation*}
                R = \Delta V / I
        \end{equation*}
\end{lessimportant}

\noindent The units of resistance are volts/ampere, usually abbreviated
as ohms, symbolized with the capital Greek letter omega, $\Omega$.\index{ohm (unit)}

\begin{eg}{Resistance of a lightbulb}
\egquestion
A flashlight bulb powered by a 9-volt battery has
a resistance of 10 $\Omega$. How much current will it draw?

        \eganswer
        Solving the definition of resistance for $I$, we find
        \begin{align*}
                         I         &=    \Delta V/ R  \\
                                 &=     0.9\ \zu{V}/\Omega   \\
                                 &=     0.9\ \zu{V}/(\zu{V}/\zu{A})  \\
                                 &=    \text{0.9 A}  
        \end{align*}

\end{eg}

        Ohm's law\index{Ohm's law}
states that many substances, including many solids
and some liquids, display this kind of behavior, at least
for voltages that are not too large. The fact that Ohm's law
is called a ``law'' should not be taken to mean that all
materials obey it, or that it has the same fundamental
importance as Newton's laws, for example. Materials are
called \index{ohmic!defined}\emph{ohmic} or \emph{nonohmic},
depending on whether they obey Ohm's law. Although we will
concentrate on ohmic materials in this book, it's important to keep in
mind that a great many materials are nonohmic, and devices made from them
are often very important. For instance, a transistor\index{transistor} is a nonohmic device
that can be used to amplify a signal (as in a guitar amplifier) or to store and
manipulate the ones and zeroes in a computer chip.

In our previous discussion of conductors
(sec.~\ref{sec:const-v-in-conductor},
p.~\pageref{sec:const-v-in-conductor}), we saw that a perfect
conductor has certain characteristics: the potential is constant
throughout it, the electric field is perpendicular to its surface, and
any net density of charge is present only at the surface. These
statements are exact for a material with exactly zero resistance, and
are often good approximations for objects like a copper wire, but in
general there is no sharp distinction between insulators and
conductors.  Some materials, such as silicon, lie midway between the
two extremes, and are called semiconductors. 

On an intuitive level, we can understand the idea of
resistance by making the sounds ``hhhhhh'' and ``ffffff.''
To make air flow out of your mouth, you use your diaphragm
to compress the air in your chest. The pressure difference
between your chest and the air outside your mouth is
analogous to a voltage difference. When you make the ``h''
sound, you form your mouth and throat in a way that allows
air to flow easily. The large flow of air is like a large
current. Dividing by a large current in the definition of
resistance means that we get a small resistance. We say that
the small resistance of your mouth and throat allows a large
current to flow. When you make the ``f'' sound, you increase
the resistance and cause a smaller current to flow.

Note that although the resistance of an object depends on
the substance it is made of, we cannot speak simply of the
``resistance of gold'' or the ``resistance of wood.'' 
Figure \ref{fig:resistance-depends-on-shape} shows four examples of objects that have had wires
attached at the ends as electrical connections. If they were
made of the same substance, they would all nevertheless have
different resistances because of their different sizes and
shapes. A more detailed discussion will be more natural in
the context of the following chapter, but it should not be
too surprising that the resistance of \ref{fig:resistance-depends-on-shape}/2 will be greater
than that of \ref{fig:resistance-depends-on-shape}/1 --- the image of water flowing through a
pipe, however incorrect, gives us the right intuition.
Object \ref{fig:resistance-depends-on-shape}/3 will have a smaller 
resistance than \ref{fig:resistance-depends-on-shape}/1 because
the charged particles have less of it to get through.

All materials display some variation in resistance according
to temperature (a fact that is used in thermostats to make a
thermometer that can be easily interfaced to an electric
circuit). More spectacularly, most metals have been found to
exhibit a sudden change to \emph{zero} resistance when
cooled to a certain critical temperature. They are then said
to be superconductors. Currently, the most important practical
application of superconductivity is in medical MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanners.
When your
body is inserted into one of these devices, you are being immersed in an extremely strong magnetic
field produced by electric currents flowing through the coiled wires of an electromagnet.
If these wires were not superconducting, they would instantly burn up because of the heat
generated by their resistance.

There are many other potential applications for superconductors, but most of these, such as
power transmission, are not currently economically feasible because of the extremely low
temperatures required for superconductivity to occur.

However, it was discovered in 1986 that
certain ceramics are superconductors at less extreme
temperatures. The technological barrier is now in finding
practical methods for making wire out of these brittle
materials. Wall Street is currently investing billions of
dollars in developing superconducting devices for cellular
phone relay stations based on these materials.

There is currently no satisfactory theory of superconductivity
in general, although superconductivity in metals is
understood fairly well. Unfortunately I have yet to find a
fundamental explanation of superconductivity in metals that
works at the introductory level.

So far we have been assuming a perfect conductor. What if it
is a good conductor, but not a perfect one? Then we can
solve for $\Delta V=IR$. An ordinary-sized current
will make a very small result when we multiply it by the
resistance of a good conductor such as a metal wire. The
voltage throughout the wire will then be nearly constant.
If, on the other hand, the current is extremely large, we
can have a significant voltage difference. This is what
happens in a \index{circuit!short}\index{short circuit!defined}\emph{short-circuit:\/}
a circuit in which a low-resistance pathway connects the two
sides of a voltage source. Note that this is much more
specific than the popular use of the term to indicate any

short-circuit a 9-volt battery as shown in figure \ref{fig:short-circuit}, you
will produce perhaps a thousand amperes of current, leading
to a very large value of $P=I\Delta V$. The wire gets hot!

Many electrical devices are based on electrical resistance
and Ohm's law, even if they do not have little components in
them that look like the usual resistor. The following are some examples.

There is nothing special about a lightbulb filament --- you
can easily make a lightbulb by cutting a narrow waist into a
metallic gum wrapper and connecting the wrapper across the
terminals of a 9-volt battery. The trouble is that it will
instantly burn out. Edison solved this technical challenge
by encasing the filament in an evacuated bulb, which
prevented burning, since burning requires oxygen.

The polygraph, or ``lie detector,'' is really just a set of
meters for recording physical measures of the subject's

heartbeat. The real-time sweat measurement works on the
principle that dry skin is a good insulator, but sweaty skin
is a conductor. Of course a truthful subject may become
nervous simply because of the situation, and a practiced
liar may not even break a sweat. The method's practitioners
claim that they can tell the difference, but you should
think twice before allowing yourself to be polygraph tested.
Most U.S. courts exclude all polygraph evidence, but some
employers attempt to screen out dishonest employees by
polygraph testing job applicants, an abuse that ranks with
such pseudoscience as handwriting analysis.

<% begin_sec("Fuse") %>

A fuse is a device inserted in a circuit tollbooth-style in
the same manner as an ammeter. It is simply a piece of wire
made of metals having a relatively low melting point. If too
much current passes through the fuse, it melts, opening the
circuit. The purpose is to make sure that the building's
wires do not carry so much current that they themselves will
get hot enough to start a fire. Most modern houses use
circuit breakers instead of fuses, although fuses are still
common in cars and small devices. A circuit breaker is a
switch operated by a coiled-wire magnet, which opens the
circuit when enough current flows. The advantage is that
once you turn off some of the appliances that were sucking
up too much current, you can immediately flip the switch
closed. In the days of fuses, one might get caught without a
replacement fuse, or even be tempted to stuff aluminum foil
in as a replacement, defeating the safety feature.

We use ``flipping a switch'' as a metaphor for making something happen
instantly, but it's not obvious how this happens physically in an actual
circuit. When we turn on a light, we convert an open circuit into a complete
circuit. Charge starts to flow through the copper wires, but if we make an order-of-magnitude
estimate of the speed at which it needs to flow in order to carry a typical current,
the result is on the order of centimeters per second (\note{drift-velocity}).
This slow speed is called the drift velocity, and clearly it is much less than
the speed at which energy flows. Figure \figref{chain-drive} shows a mechanical analogy.
A torque applied to one wheel is transmitted to the other wheel very rapidly, at
a speed much greater than the speed at which the links in the roller chain travel.
If the chain is tight, the speed at which the energy travels could be similar to
the speed of sound in the metal. In an electric circuit, we are concerned with the
speed of light rather than the speed of sound. Relativity guarantees that the flow of energy
and information cannot be greater than $c$, but in most cases it is some significant
fraction of $c$.

Figure \figref{circuit-poynting} shows the results of a fairly realistic simulation of
how the energy flows in an actual electric circuit shaped like a rectangle, with most of
the resistance being supplied by the resistor on the right, but a smaller amount also
present in the wires. This is a simulation of the steady state of the circuit, when the
current has been flowing for a long time and has had time to settle down. The equipotentials
were found by solving Laplace's equation on a computer. We see that the flow of energy,
measured by the Poynting vector, is through the empty space surrounding the wires, not
the wires themselves. Energy flows out of the battery and into the resistor, and we can
also see that some flows into the wires, since the Poynting vectors near the wires are
angled slightly inward. This flow of energy causes the wires and the resistor to heat up.
Note that the current is sometimes in the same direction as the energy flow and sometimes
in the opposite direction.

If we were to suddenly open or close a switch in a circuit like this, the situation would
be more complicated, but
roughly speaking, we would expect that the changes in the energy flow would be initiated
near the switch and then spread out through the circuit as electromagnetic waves. These
would not be plane waves (and therefore would not travel at exactly $c$). They would
be guided around the circuit by the wires. That is, the wires act not so much like
pipes through which the energy flows, and more like railroad tracks that tell the cars
where to go --- the term ``switch'' originated in railroads, where it means the mechanism
that allows cars to be directed onto one set of tracks or another when the train comes
to a ``Y'' (figure \figref{railroad-switches}).

Suppose that a copper wire contains one electron per atom that is free to move.
Then the number density $n$ of charge carriers is the same as the number density
of copper atoms, which is just the inverse of the volume of an atom,
$n\sim (1\ \zu{nm})^{-3}=10^{27}\ \zu{m}^3$. When these electrons flow with
an average velocity $v$, the absolute value of the current is $I=nevA$, where $A$
is the wire's cross-sectional area. Putting in a typical current of 1 A and a
cross-section area of one square millimeter, we find $v\sim1\ \zu{cm}/\sunit$.
