I see a chess position; Kasparov sees an interesting Ruy
Lopez variation. To the uninitiated a schematic may look as
unintelligible as Mayan hieroglyphs, but even a little bit
of eye training can go a long way toward making its meaning
leap off the page. A \index{schematic}schematic is a
stylized and simplified drawing of a circuit. The purpose is
to eliminate as many irrelevant features as possible, so
that the relevant ones are easier to pick out.

An example of an irrelevant feature is the physical shape,
length, and diameter of a wire. In nearly all circuits, it
is a good approximation to assume that the wires are perfect
conductors, so that any piece of wire uninterrupted by other
components has constant potential throughout it. Changing the
length of the wire, for instance, does not change this fact.
(Of course if we used miles and miles of wire, as in a
telephone line, the wire's resistance would start to add up,
and its length would start to matter.) The shapes of the
wires are likewise irrelevant, so we draw them with
standardized, stylized shapes made only of vertical and
horizontal lines with right-angle bends in them. This has
the effect of making similar circuits look more alike and
helping us to recognize familiar patterns, just as words in
a newspaper are easier to recognize than handwritten ones.
Figure \ref{fig:sample-schematics} shows some examples of these concepts.

The most important first step in learning to read schematics
is to learn to recognize contiguous pieces of wire which
must have constant potential throughout. In figure \ref{fig:constant-voltage-areas}, for
example, the two shaded E-shaped pieces of wire must each
have constant potential. This focuses our attention on two of
the main unknowns we'd like to be able to predict: the
potential of the left-hand E and the potential of the one on the right.

\index{resistance!in parallel}\index{junction rule}

One of the simplest examples to analyze is the parallel
resistance circuit, of which figure \figref{constant-voltage-areas} was an example. In
general we may have unequal resistances $R_1$ and $R_2$, as
in \figref{parallel-resistors}/1. Since there are only two constant-potential areas in
the circuit, \figref{parallel-resistors}/2, all three components have the same potential
difference across them. A battery normally succeeds in
maintaining the potential differences across itself for which
it was designed, so the voltage drops $\Delta V_1$ and
$\Delta V_2$ across the resistors must both equal the
voltage of the battery:
\begin{equation*}
        \Delta V_1=\Delta V_2=\Delta V_{battery}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Each resistance thus feels the same potential difference as if
it was the only one in the circuit, and Ohm's law tells us
that the amount of current flowing through each one is also
the same as it would have been in a one-resistor circuit.
This is why household electrical circuits are wired in
parallel. We want every appliance to work the same,
regardless of whether other appliances are plugged in or
unplugged, turned on or switched off. (The electric company
doesn't use batteries of course, but our analysis would be
the same for any device that maintains a constant voltage.)

Of course the electric company can tell when we turn on
every light in the house. How do they know? The answer is
that we draw more current. Each resistance draws a certain
amount of current, and the amount that has to be supplied is
the sum of the two individual currents. The current is like
a river that splits in half, \ref{fig:parallel-resistors}/3, and then reunites.
The total current is
\begin{equation*}
                I_{total}         =    I_1 + I_2\eqquad.  
\end{equation*}

This is an example of a general fact called the junction rule:

\begin{lessimportant}[the junction rule]
        In any circuit that is not storing or releasing charge, conservation of
        charge implies that the total current flowing out of any junction must be the
        same as the total flowing in.
\end{lessimportant}

Coming back to the analysis of our circuit, we apply Ohm's
law to each resistance, resulting in
\begin{align*}
                I_{total}         &=    \Delta V/R_1+ \Delta V/R_2  \\
                         &=             \Delta V\left(\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}\right)\eqquad.  
\end{align*}

As far as the electric company is concerned, your whole
house is just one resistor with some resistance $R$, called
the \index{resistors!in parallel}\index{equivalent
resistance!of resistors in parallel}\emph{equivalent resistance}.
They would write Ohm's law as
\begin{equation*}
                        I_{total}         =    \Delta V/R\eqquad,  
\end{equation*}
from which we can determine the equivalent resistance by
comparison with the previous expression:
\begin{align*}
                        1/R         &=   \frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}   \\
                          R         &=  \left(\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}\right)^{-1}          
\end{align*}
\hfill{}[equivalent resistance of two resistors in parallel]

\noindent Two resistors in parallel, \ref{fig:parallel-resistors}/4, are equivalent to a single
resistor with a value given by the above equation.

\begin{eg}{Two lamps on the same household circuit}
\egquestion
You turn on two lamps that are on the same
household circuit. Each one has a resistance of 1 ohm. What
is the equivalent resistance, and how does the power
dissipation compare with the case of a single lamp?

\eganswer
        The equivalent resistance of the two lamps in parallel is
\begin{align*}
                 R         &=    \left(\frac{1}{ R_1}+\frac{1}{ R_2}\right)^{-1}  \\
                         &=    \left(\frac{1}{1\ \Omega}+\frac{1}{1\ \Omega}\right)^{-1}  \\
                         &=    \left(1\ \Omega^{-1} + 1\ \Omega^{-1}\right)^{-1}  \\
                         &=    \left(2\ \Omega^{-1}\right)^{-1}  \\
                         &=    \text{0.5}\ \Omega   
\end{align*}
The potential difference across the whole circuit is always
the 110 V set by the electric company (it's alternating
current, but that's irrelevant). The resistance of the whole
circuit has been cut in half by turning on the second lamp,
so a fixed amount of voltage will produce twice as much
current. Twice the current flowing across the same potential
difference means twice as much power dissipation, which makes sense.

\end{eg}

The cutting in half of the resistance surprises many
students, since we are ``adding more resistance'' to the
circuit by putting in the second lamp. Why does the
equivalent resistance come out to be less than the
resistance of a single lamp? This is a case where purely
verbal reasoning can be misleading. A resistive circuit
element, such as the filament of a lightbulb, is neither a
perfect insulator nor a perfect conductor. Instead of
analyzing this type of circuit in terms of ``resistors,''
i.e., partial insulators, we could have spoken of ``conductors.''
This example would then seem reasonable, since we ``added
more conductance,'' but one would then have the incorrect
expectation about the case of resistors in series, discussed
in the following section.

Perhaps a more productive way of thinking about it is to use
mechanical intuition. By analogy, your nostrils resist the
flow of air through them, but having two nostrils makes it
twice as easy to breathe.

\begin{eg}{Three resistors in parallel}\label{eg:three-resistors-in-parallel}
\egquestion
What happens if we have three or more resistors in parallel?

\eganswer
        This is an important example, because the solution
involves an important technique for understanding circuits:
breaking them down into smaller parts and them simplifying
those parts. In the circuit \ref{fig:eg-three-resistors-in-parallel}/1, with three resistors in
parallel, we can think of two of the resistors as forming a
single resistor, \ref{fig:eg-three-resistors-in-parallel}/2, with equivalent resistance 
\begin{equation*}
                 R_{12}         =    \left(\frac{1}{ R_1}+\frac{1}{ R_2}\right)^{-1}\eqquad.  
\end{equation*}
We can then simplify the circuit as shown in \ref{fig:eg-three-resistors-in-parallel}/3, so that it
contains only two resistances. The equivalent resistance of
the whole circuit is then given by
\begin{equation*}
                 R_{123}    =    \left(\frac{1}{ R_{12}}+\frac{1}{ R_3}\right)^{-1}\eqquad.  
\end{equation*}
Substituting for $R_{12}$ and simplifying, we find the result
\begin{equation*}
                 R_{123}    =  \left(\frac{1}{ R_1}+\frac{1}{ R_2}+\frac{1}{ R_3}\right)^{-1}\eqquad,  
\end{equation*}
which you probably could have guessed. The interesting point
here is the divide-and-conquer concept, not the mathematical result.

\begin{eg}{An arbitrary number of identical resistors in parallel}
\egquestion
What is the resistance of $N$ identical resistors in parallel?

\eganswer
        Generalizing the results for two and three resistors, we have
\begin{equation*}
                 R_{N}         =   \left(\frac{1}{ R_1}+\frac{1}{ R_2}+\ldots\right)^{-1}\eqquad,  
\end{equation*}
where ``...'' means that the sum includes all the resistors.
If all the resistors are identical, this becomes
\begin{align*}
                 R_{N}         &=  \left(\frac{ N}{ R}\right)^{-1}    \\
                         &=     \frac{ R}{ N}

\begin{eg}{Dependence of resistance on cross-sectional area}\label{eg:resistance-and-area}
We have alluded briefly to the fact that an object's
electrical resistance depends on its size and shape, but now
we are ready to begin making more mathematical statements
about it. As suggested by figure \ref{fig:eg-cross-sectional-area}, increasing a
resistors's cross-sectional area is equivalent to adding
more resistors in parallel, which will lead to an overall
decrease in resistance. Any real resistor with straight,
parallel sides can be sliced up into a large number of
pieces, each with cross-sectional area of, say, 1 $\mu \zu{m}^2$.
The number, $N$, of such slices is proportional to the total
cross-sectional area of the resistor, and by application of
the result of the previous example we therefore find that
the resistance of an object is inversely proportional to its
cross-sectional area.

        An analogous relationship holds for water pipes, which is

areas. To make lots of water (current) flow through a skinny

\begin{eg}{Incorrect readings from a voltmeter}
        A voltmeter is really just an ammeter with an internal
resistor, and we use a voltmeter in parallel with the thing
that we're trying to measure the potential difference across.
This means that any time we measure the voltage drop across
a resistor, we're essentially putting two resistors in
parallel. The ammeter inside the voltmeter can be ignored
for the purpose of analyzing how current flows in the
circuit, since it is essentially just some coiled-up wire
with a very low resistance.

              really constructing a parallel resistance circuit, 2.
    }
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

        Now if we are carrying out this measurement on a resistor
that is part of a larger circuit, we have changed the
behavior of the circuit through our act of measuring. It is
as though we had modified the circuit by replacing the
resistance $R$ with the smaller equivalent resistance of $R$
and $R_v$ in parallel. It is for this reason that voltmeters
are built with the largest possible internal resistance. As
a numerical example, if we use a voltmeter with an internal
resistance of 1 $\zu{M}\Omega $ to measure the voltage drop
across a one-ohm resistor, the equivalent resistance is
0.999999 $\Omega $, which is not different enough to make
any difference. But if we tried to use the same voltmeter to
measure the voltage drop across a 2 $M\Omega$ resistor, we
would be reducing the resistance of that part of the circuit
by a factor of three, which would produce a drastic change
in the behavior of the whole circuit.
\end{eg}

        This is the reason why you can't use a voltmeter to measure
the potential difference between two different points in
mid-air, or between the ends of a piece of wood. This is by
no means a stupid thing to want to do, since the world
around us is not a constant-potential environment, the most
extreme example being when an electrical storm is brewing.
But it will not work with an ordinary voltmeter because the
resistance of the air or the wood is many gigaohms. The
effect of waving a pair of voltmeter probes around in the
air is that we provide a reuniting path for the positive and
negative charges that have been separated --- through the
voltmeter itself, which is a good conductor compared to the
air. This reduces to zero the potential difference we
were trying to measure.

        In general, a voltmeter that has been set up with an open
circuit (or a very large resistance) between its probes is
said to be ``floating.'' An old-fashioned analog voltmeter
of the type described here will read zero when left
floating, the same as when it was sitting on the shelf. A
floating digital voltmeter usually shows an error message.

\index{resistance!in series}

The two basic circuit layouts are parallel and series, so a
pair of resistors in series, \ref{fig:seriesresistors}/1, is another of the most
basic circuits we can make. By conservation of charge, all
the current that flows through one resistor must also flow
through the other (as well as through the battery):
\begin{equation*}
                I_1    =    I_2\eqquad.  
\end{equation*}
The only way the information about the two resistance values
is going to be useful is if we can apply Ohm's law, which
will relate the resistance of each resistor to the current
flowing through it and the voltage difference across it.
Figure \ref{fig:seriesresistors}/2 shows the three constant-potential areas. Voltage
differences are more physically significant than voltages,
so we define symbols for the voltage differences across the
two resistors in figure \ref{fig:seriesresistors}/3.

We have three constant-potential areas, with symbols for the
difference in voltage between every possible pair of them.
These three potential differences must be related to each
other. It is as though I tell you that Fred is a foot taller
than Ginger, Ginger is a foot taller than Sally, and Fred is
two feet taller than Sally. The information is redundant,
and you really only needed two of the three pieces of data
to infer the third. In the case of our voltage differences, we have
\begin{equation*}
           |\Delta V_1| + |\Delta V_2| = |\Delta V_{battery}|\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
The absolute value signs are because of the ambiguity in how
we define our voltage differences. If we reversed the two
probes of the voltmeter, we would get a result with the
opposite sign. Digital voltmeters will actually provide a
minus sign on the screen if the wire connected to the ``V''
plug is lower in potential than the one connected to the
``COM'' plug. Analog voltmeters pin the needle against a peg
if you try to use them to measure negative voltages, so you
have to fiddle to get the leads connected the right way, and
then supply any necessary minus sign yourself.

Figure \ref{fig:seriesresistors}/4 shows a standard way of taking care of the
ambiguity in signs. For each of the three voltage measurements
around the loop, we keep the same probe (the darker one) on
the clockwise side. It is as though the voltmeter was
sidling around the circuit like a crab, without ever
``crossing its legs.'' With this convention, the relationship
among the voltage drops becomes
\begin{equation*}
          \Delta V_1 + \Delta V_2 = -\Delta V_{battery}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
or, in more symmetrical form,
\begin{equation*}
          \Delta V_1 + \Delta V_2 + \Delta V_{battery} = 0\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

More generally, this is known as the loop rule for analyzing circuits:

\begin{lessimportant}[the loop rule]
        Assuming the standard convention for plus and minus signs, the sum of the
        voltage drops around any closed loop in a DC circuit must be zero.
\end{lessimportant}

The loop rule and junction rule are credited to Gustav Kirchoff and are therefore
often referred to by names such as Kirchoff's rules, Kirchoff's loop rule, Kirchoff's junction rule,
and acronyms such as KCL (for current) and KVL (for voltage).

In a DC circuit, we have a well-defined electric potential, which is analogous to height
in a gravitational field.
Looking for an exception to the \index{loop rule}loop rule
would be like asking for a hike that would be downhill all
the way and that would come back to its starting point, or a staircase like the one in
figure \figref{penrose-stairs}.
The sum of voltage drops described in the loop rule is the work
done per unit charge as we bring a charge around the loop and
back to its starting point. If this work were nonzero for a static field, then as
argued in sec.~\ref{sec:something-is-missing}, p.~\pageref{zero-work-around-closed-loop},
we would have a perpetual motion machine, violating conservation of energy.
The assumption of a DC circuit (static field) is necessary, and the loop rule
can be violated when the fields are time-varying (\note{loop-rule-dc-necessary}).

        For the circuit we set out to analyze, the equation
\begin{equation*}
          \Delta V_1 + \Delta V_2 + \Delta V_{battery} = 0
\end{equation*}
can now be rewritten by applying Ohm's law to each resistor:
\begin{equation*}
          I_1R_1 + I_2R_2 + \Delta V_{battery} = 0\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
The currents are the same, so we can factor them out:
\begin{equation*}
          I\left(R_1 + R_2\right) + \Delta V_{battery} = 0\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
and this is the same result we would have gotten if we had
been analyzing a one-resistor circuit with resistance
$R_1+R_2$. Thus the equivalent resistance of resistors in
series equals the sum of their resistances.

\begin{eg}{Two lightbulbs in series}\label{eg:two-bulbs-in-series}
\egquestion
If two identical  lightbulbs are placed in series,
how do their brightnesses compare with the brightness of a single bulb?

\eganswer
        Taken as a whole, the pair of bulbs act like a
doubled resistance, so they will draw half as much current
from the wall. Each bulb will be dimmer than a single
bulb would have been.

The total power dissipated by the circuit is $I\Delta V$.
        The voltage drop across the whole circuit is the same as
        before, but the current is halved, so the two-bulb circuit
        draws half as much total power as the one-bulb circuit. Each
        bulb draws one-quarter of the normal power.

        Roughly speaking, we might expect this to result in one
quarter the light being produced by each bulb, but in
reality lightbulbs waste quite a high percentage of their
power in the form of heat and wavelengths of light that are
not visible (infrared and ultraviolet). Less light will be
produced, but it's hard to predict exactly how much less,
since the efficiency of the bulbs will be changed by
operating them under different conditions.

resistance is proportional to length. Analogously, it is
harder to blow through a long straw than through a short one.
\end{eg}

Combining the results of examples \ref{eg:resistance-and-area} and \ref{eg:resistance-and-length}, we find that the
resistance of an object with straight, parallel sides is given by
\begin{equation*}

\begin{eg}{Choice of high voltage for power lines}\label{hvtransmission}
        Thomas Edison got involved in a famous technological
controversy over the voltage difference that should be used
for electrical power lines. At this time, the public was
unfamiliar with electricity, and easily scared by it. The
president of the United States, for instance, refused to
have electrical lighting in the White House when it first
became commercially available because he considered it
unsafe, preferring the known fire hazard of oil lamps to the
mysterious dangers of electricity. Mainly as a way to
overcome public fear, Edison believed that power should be
transmitted using small voltages, and he publicized his
opinion by giving demonstrations at which a dog was lured
into position to be killed by a large voltage difference
between two sheets of metal on the ground. (Edison's
opponents also advocated alternating current rather than
direct current, and AC is more dangerous than DC as well. As
we will discuss later, AC can be easily stepped up and down
to the desired voltage level using a device called a transformer.)

                Now if we want to deliver a certain amount of power $P_L$ to
a load such as an electric lightbulb, we are constrained
only by the equation $P_{L} =  I\Delta  V_L$. We can deliver any
amount of power we wish, even with a low voltage, if we are
willing to use large currents. Modern electrical distribution
networks, however, use dangerously high voltage differences
of tens of thousands of volts. Why did Edison lose the debate?  

        It boils down to money. The electric company must deliver
the amount of power $P_L$ desired by the customer through a
transmission line whose resistance $R_T$ is fixed by
economics and geography. The same current flows through both
the load and the transmission line, dissipating power
usefully in the former and wastefully in the latter. The
efficiency of the system is
\begin{align*}
                \text{efficiency}         &=   \frac{\text{power paid for by the customer}}
                                                                        {\text{power paid for by the utility}}   \\
                                 &=  \frac{ P_{L}}{ P_L+ P_{T}}    \\
                                 &=   \frac{1}{1+ P_{T}/ P_L}   
\end{align*}
Putting ourselves in the shoes of the electric company, we
wish to get rid of the variable $P_T$, since it is something
we control only indirectly by our choice of $\Delta  V_T$ and
$I$. Substituting $P_{T}= I\Delta  V_T$, we find
\begin{equation*}
                \text{efficiency}         =      \frac{1}
                                                {1+\frac{ I \Delta V_T}{ P_L}}
\end{equation*}
We assume the transmission line (but not necessarily the
load) is ohmic, so substituting $\Delta V_T=IR_T$ gives
\begin{equation*}
                \text{efficiency}         =      \frac{1}{1+\frac{I^2R_T}{P_L}}
\end{equation*}
This quantity can clearly be maximized by making $I$ as
small as possible, since we will then be dividing by the
smallest possible quantity on the bottom of the fraction. A
low-current circuit can only deliver significant amounts of
power if it uses high voltages, which is why electrical
transmission systems use dangerous high voltages.

\begin{eg}{Two ways of handling signs}\label{eg:qbert}
The figure above shows two ways of visualizing the loop rule and handling the signs involved.
In panel 1, each circuit element is labeled with the voltage drop across it.

In 2, the crab is a voltmeter whose reading is the potential on the white claw
minus the potential on the black claw. The crab can't flip over. It can only scuttle sideways as it moves around
the loop that we've chosen, consisting of four resistors. The sum of the four readings is zero.

Panel 3 shows a visualization of the same circuit in which potential is like height. The stick figure on the ledge
wants to get down to the ground by doing a series of hops. He has two ways: do the 3 V drop and then the 1 V drop,
or do the 2 V and the other 2 V. Here we treat all the voltage differences as positive numbers.
This method works nicely if you're pretty sure for each resistor in the circuit which end is the higher
voltage.

\begin{eg}{A complicated circuit}\label{eg:close-switch}
\egquestion
All seven resistors in the left-hand panel of figure \figref{eg-close-switch} are identical.
Initially, the switch S is open as shown in the figure, and the current through resistor A is $I_\zu{o}$.
The switch is then closed. Find the current through resistor B, after the switch is closed, in terms of $I_\zu{o}$.

\eganswer
The second panel shows the circuit redrawn for simplicity, in the initial condition with the switch open.
When the switch is open, no current can flow through the central resistor, so we may as well ignore it.
I've also redrawn the junctions, without changing what's connected to what. This is the kind of mental
rearranging that you'll eventually learn to do automatically from experience with analyzing circuits.
The redrawn version makes it easier to see what's happening with the current. Charge is conserved, so
any charge that flows past point 1 in the circuit must also flow past points 2 and 3. This would have
been harder to reason about by applying the junction rule to the original version, which appears to have nine separate junctions.

In the new version, it's also clear that the circuit has a great deal of symmetry. We could flip over each
parallel pair of identical resistors without changing what's connected to what, so that makes it clear that the voltage
drops and currents must be equal for the members of each pair. We can also prove this by using the loop rule.
The loop rule says that the two voltage drops in loop 4 must be equal, and similarly for loops 5 and 6.
Since the resistors obey Ohm's law, equal voltage drops across them also imply equal currents. That means
that when the current at point 1 comes to the top junction, exactly half of it goes through each resistor. Then
the current reunites at 2, splits between the next pair, and so on. We conclude that each of the six resistors
in the circuit experiences the same voltage drop and the same current. Applying the loop rule to loop 7, we
find that the sum of the three voltage drops across the three left-hand resistors equals the battery's
voltage, $V$, so each resistor in the circuit experiences a voltage drop $V/3$. Letting $R$ stand for
the resistance of one of the resistors, we find that the current through resistor B, which is the same
as the currents through all the others, is given by $I_\zu{o}=V/3R$.

We now pass to the case where the switch is closed, as shown in the third panel. The battery's voltage is
the same as before, and each resistor's resistance is the same, so we can still use the same symbols
$V$ and $R$ for them. It is no longer true, however, that each resistor feels a voltage drop $V/3$.
The equivalent resistance of the whole circuit is $R/2+R/3+R/2=4R/3$, so the total current drawn from
the battery is $3V/4R$. In the middle group of resistors, this current is split three ways, so the new current
through B is $(1/3)(3V/4R)=V/4R=3I_\zu{o}/4$.

Interpreting this result, we see that it comes from two effects that partially cancel.
Closing the switch reduces the equivalent resistance of the circuit by giving charge another
way to flow, and increases the amount of current drawn from the battery. Resistor B, however,
only gets a 1/3 share of this greater current, not 1/2. The second effect turns out to be
bigger than first, and therefore the current through resistor B is lessened
over all.

\begin{eg}{Getting killed by your ammeter}
        As with a voltmeter, an ammeter can give erroneous readings
if it is used in such a way that it changes the behavior the
circuit. An ammeter is used in series, so if it is used to
measure the current through a resistor, the resistor's value
will effectively be changed to $R+ R_a$, where $R_a$ is the
resistance of the ammeter. Ammeters are designed with very
low resistances in order to make it unlikely that $R+ R_a$
will be significantly different from $R$.

        In fact, the real hazard is death, not a wrong reading!
Virtually the only circuits whose resistances are significantly
less than that of an ammeter are those designed to carry
huge currents. An ammeter inserted in such a circuit can
easily melt. When I was working at a laboratory funded by
the Department of Energy, we got periodic bulletins from the
DOE safety office about serious accidents at other sites,
and they held a certain ghoulish fascination. One of these
was about a DOE worker who was completely incinerated by the
explosion created when he inserted an ordinary Radio Shack
ammeter into a high-current circuit. Later estimates showed
that the heat was probably so intense that the explosion was
a ball of plasma --- a gas so hot that its atoms have been ionized.

\startdq

\begin{dq}
        We have stated the loop rule in a symmetric form where a
        series of voltage drops adds up to zero. To do this, we had
        to define a standard way of connecting the voltmeter to the
        circuit so that the plus and minus signs would come out
        right. Suppose we wish to restate the junction rule in a
        similar symmetric way, so that instead of equating the
        current coming in to the current going out, it simply states
        that a certain sum of currents at a junction adds up to
        zero. What standard way of inserting the ammeter would we
        have to use to make this work?

\notetext{loop-rule-dc-necessary}{Loop rule violated by AC circuits}
\notesummary{The loop rule is valid only for static fields (DC circuits), and can be violated otherwise.}
        To see why the assumption of a DC circuit is necessary, consider what happens
        in an antenna, as in figure \figref{dipole-radiation-pattern} on 
        p.~\pageref{eg:dipole-radiation-pattern}. In such an AC circuit,
        a charge can oscillate back and forth repeatedly, having negative work
        done on it in each cycle. This is not a violation of conservation of energy,
        because the energy is being pumped out into an electromagnetic wave.
        The electric field in the antenna's radiation pattern is curly (which is allowed
        by Maxwell's equations because $\operatorname{curl}\vc{E}=-\partial\vc{B}/\partial t$),
        so the work done by the field is path-dependent, and the construction of the electric
        potential in \ref{sec:potential}, p.~\pageref{sec:potential}, breaks down. In the gravitational
        metaphor, there is no way to even define a notion of height.

This exercise is based on one created by Virginia Roundy.

\noindent Apparatus:

\begin{indentedblock}
DC power supply

1.5 volt batteries

lightbulbs and holders

wire

highlighting pens, 3 colors
\end{indentedblock}

When you first glance at this exercise, it may look scary and intimidating --- all those
circuits! However, all those wild-looking circuits can be analyzed using the following four
guides to thinking:

1. \emph{A circuit has to be complete\/}, i.e., it must be possible for charge to get recycled
as it goes around the circuit. If it's not complete, then charge will build up at a dead end. This built-up
charge will repel any other charge that tries to get in, and everything will rapidly grind to a stop.

2. \emph{There is constant voltage everywhere along a piece of wire.} To apply this rule during
this lab, I suggest you use the colored highlighting pens to mark the circuit. For instance, if there's
one whole piece of the circuit that's all at the same voltage, you could highlight it in yellow.
A second piece of the circuit, at some other voltage, could be highlighted in blue.

3. \emph{Charge is conserved,} so charge can't ``get used up.''

\pagebreak

4. You can draw a \emph{rollercoaster diagram}, like the one shown below. On this
kind of diagram, height corresponds to voltage --- that's why the wires are drawn as horizontal
tracks.

\emph{A Bulb and a Switch}

Look at circuit 1, and try to predict what will happen when the switch is open, and what
will happen when it's closed. Write both your predictions in the table on the following page
before you build the circuit.
When you build the circuit, you don't need an actual switch like a light switch; just 
connect and disconnect the banana plugs. Use one of the 1.5 volt batteries as your voltage
source.
