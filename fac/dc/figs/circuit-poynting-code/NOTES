I'm not sure if I'm modeling the battery realistically. I just take it
as a constant potential gradient, which makes it not so different from
the resistances.

Someone else's drawing that looks almost exactly like mine, seems to
confirm that it's pretty much correct:

Physics:

If you write out Maxwell's equations for a DC case like this, and throw
out all the time derivatives, you do get the same equations that lead
to Poisson's equation.

The code outputs an approximation to the laplacian along the wires. This
tells me roughly what the charge density is, so that I can get the density
of field lines sort of right. Going clockwise from + terminal of battery,
charge density goes like .3, .3, .2, -.2, -.3, -.3. This is why I have
electric field lines slightly more dense on the left as they terminate on
the wire.

Field is small near the center. Drawing is a 2-d slice, so it makes it look
like this is not the case, but actually the density of field lines is
small there. I didn't know how to space out the field lines near the
center, made them approximately equally spaced.

Fields have small components parallel to surface of wires, because wires
are modeled with finite resistance. This is why Poynting vector points
slightly inward toward wires. In units where the main resistor has a
resistance of 100, each wire is 30.
